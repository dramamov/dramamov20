00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:42.140
What a pity.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.541
It's truly shattered.

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:45.541
But it's beautiful.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.340
You really don't remember me?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.021
I mean,

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:03.220
I met you when I was little.

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:07.181
When I was seven,

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.140
I accidentally fell into water

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.420
and lost all memories from before that.

00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:17.261
I manage

00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:18.781
the Xue family now.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.460
My sister Nuannuan

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.700
is kind and pure.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.420
Dongyang and Jiaoqian treat us well.

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:25.020
Grandmother

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:27.300
is quite strict.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.900
But towards us,

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:30.221
she's been affectionate.

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:32.781
Do they

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.261
know about me?

00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:38.460
Don't worry.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.261
They'll surely accept you.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.221
I don't

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.821
want to be an outsider.

00:02:57.821 --> 00:02:58.981
This world is vast.

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:01.221
There's always a place for me.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.580
I'm glad to meet you today.

00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:04.460
Come on.

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:08.900
I'm pleased too.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.700
Let's part ways here.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.101
Don't meet me again.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.341
Give me back.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.221
Banknotes.

00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:42.460
My coin pouch.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.900
Okay.

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:54.781
Hairpin.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.661
Fine.

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:09.620
You just hugged me

00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:10.900
and stole so many things?

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:14.941
This money is enough for my return.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.221
Keep this.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.021
I manage the Xue family now.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.341
I'll give you

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.701
500 liang every year.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.260
We're brothers

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.740
born on the same date.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.420
You've come of age now.

00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:34.981
From now on,

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.300
manage money well.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.901
We're brothers?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.341
The mistakes made

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.901
can't be undone.

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:49.620
Henceforth,

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:51.581
I'll protect you.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.300
But you mustn't

00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:54.661
do wrongful deeds again.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.300
You must live like a righteous man,

00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:58.260
okay?

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:01.141
You'll

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.820
protect me?

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.221
I'm happy to know

00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:08.260
I have a brother.

00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:10.380
Studying

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.141
is challenging to me.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.701
All I can do

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:15.661
is to help

00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:18.420
with the family affairs.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.180
When you tricked that official,

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.060
you're so plausible and glib.

00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:25.661
You must be exceptionally intelligent.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.221
Why not study properly at a school?

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.541
You might pass the imperial exams,
and bring honor to the family.

00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:38.781
Bring honor to the family?

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.380
Bring honor to the family.

00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:50.141
Alright.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.820
Deal.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.901
Deal.

00:05:57.221 --> 00:05:58.060
I'll visit you again.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.141
Good news!

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.461
Good news!

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.820
Good news!

00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:18.101
Everyone come!

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.541
Dad is awake again!

00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:22.860
Son, you've finally recovered.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.541
Though you were gravely ill,

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:30.060
it brought the Xue family
a good daughter-in-law.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.981
This is Ms. Wang.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.101
During your illness,

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:39.260
she cared for our entire family.

00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:41.180
Now that you're here,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.260
let's

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.740
consummate the wedding ceremony today.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.221
Since you're already married,

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.180
should try hard

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.581
to have a child

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.820
to continue the Xue family line.

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.180
That's what matters.

00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:58.260
Do you agree, Ms. Wang?

00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:01.221
Grandmother.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.101
It might be a bit hasty.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.300
Is it hasty?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.500
Yes.

00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.701
Not at all.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.380
(Since you don't tell me, Xue Hexu.)

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.101
(I'll go ask your father.)

00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:28.260
It's not hasty at all.

00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:31.221
I haven't consummated
the wedding ceremony.

00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.581
Now,

00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:34.740
we can finally make it done.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.060
Everyone leave.

00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.661
Ms. Wang.

00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:39.720
Take good care of my son.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.620
Dongyang.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.781
What's wrong?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.341
Dongyang, what's wrong?

00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:47.880
Jiaoqian, why step on my foot?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.581
That hurts!

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.141
I...

00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:54.420
Dongyang must've been moved

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.620
when he saw Father awaken,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.224
remembering the old days

00:07:57.224 --> 00:07:58.701
that Father fed him, right?

00:07:59.101 --> 00:07:59.701
I...

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.021
Hexu understands Dongyang best.

00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:06.300
Everyone here knows

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.940
Father dotes most on Dongyang,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.060
always treating him like a child,

00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:11.101
and loves feeding him.

00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:13.661
Since Father fell ill,

00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:16.740
no one has treated
Dongyang that way anymore.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.820
Yes.

00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:20.981
I haven't seen you in so long.

00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:24.104
My son!

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:25.576
My dear son!

00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:27.784
You've suffered.

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:30.141
Calm down.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.260
Let's drop it today.

00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:39.816
Father.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:42.740
Wait.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.660
Have a chat.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.301
If you don't want to consummate,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.221
I can help you.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.500
It's you who doesn't want me to, right?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.048
Right.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.301
I don't.

00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:03.981
Stop obsessing over me,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.380
and quit prying into my private matters.

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:08.900
Knowing everything

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.181
will only bring you harm.

00:09:20.325 --> 00:09:22.504
(Xue Mansion)

00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:42.860
Guess

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.461
what!

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.181
Today is an auspicious day.

00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:52.020
Grandmother, you're right.

00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:54.581
Today, our Xue family's
plot of land in the east

00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:55.780
yields a harvest,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.181
quite substantial.

00:09:57.341 --> 00:09:58.380
It's an auspicious sign.

00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:02.020
That's just the first one.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.981
There's another one.

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:07.140
Grandmother, you are really amazing.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.061
The tenants heard
about Father's recovery

00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:11.500
and want to hire shamans

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.900
to cleanse Father's ill fortune.

00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:14.701
It's another auspicious sign.

00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:15.941
Do you agree, Father?

00:10:17.981 --> 00:10:18.660
Hexu,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.181
it is quite exhausting.

00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:23.341
Let's spare them the trouble.

00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:25.061
It's no trouble, Father.

00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:27.221
Not at all.

00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:27.660
Father,

00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:28.821
truly no trouble.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.500
You must attend,

00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:31.221
right?

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.581
To thank them.

00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:33.672
Hexu is right.

00:10:33.672 --> 00:10:34.101
Yes.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.181
I'm full, Grandmother.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.500
Where are you two going?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.136
I wasn't finished speaking.

00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:40.860
We're done eating.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.576
Take your time.

00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:43.368
Yes, Hexu is right.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.380
Xue Hexu keeps causing trouble
every day.

00:10:56.744 --> 00:10:57.301
(Rice: 500 liang)

00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.620
Something's off here.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.020
I noticed something wrong
in the ledgers today.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.301
(Now that they are out,)

00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:06.500
(so I can check properly.)

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.981
(This expense of 500 liang)

00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:10.860
(doesn't have exact remarks and timing,)

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.620
(but there's still a clue.)

00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:30.024
(It started 13 years ago)

00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:31.061
(as seen in this ledger.)

00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:34.740
(Expenses of 500 liang per year)

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.500
(all flowed to the same southern bank.)

00:11:51.528 --> 00:11:53.864
(Zhang Fu)

00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:58.780
Zhang Fu?

00:12:00.301 --> 00:12:03.421
(I remember this name wasn't listed
on the family register.)

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:05.981
(Could it be...)

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:12.780
Lord Xue.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.632
I suspect the Xue Mansion
dismissed people

00:12:14.632 --> 00:12:15.540
13 years ago.

00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:16.821
Go check it.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.860
Understood.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.660
Understood.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:24.500
Fool!

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.581
(Xue Hexu is not here.)

00:12:28.461 --> 00:12:30.061
(Let me interrogate the others.)

00:12:40.101 --> 00:12:41.181
Have you seen this man?

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:48.900
Seen this man?

00:13:02.504 --> 00:13:03.020
Father?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:03.981
I need to pee.

00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:05.140
I'm heading back.

00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:14.248
(Xue Mansion)

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.341
Who are you?

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.860
Where are you taking me?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.020
How dare you!

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.981
Apologies, my lord.

00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:29.301
Move!

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.061
Move!

00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:36.780
By Old Madam's order,

00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:39.301
today is my lord's day for consummation.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.900
Everyone,

00:13:41.101 --> 00:13:42.900
including every last servant,

00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:44.181
must remain in their rooms.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.260
No exceptions.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.260
My son,

00:13:54.181 --> 00:13:56.221
this is the best I can do.

00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:09.101
When I married into the Xue family,

00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:10.660
you fell gravely ill.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.780
Now that you're recovering,

00:14:14.701 --> 00:14:16.900
I still know so little about you.

00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:19.500
I fear I might offend you
without noticing.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.341
Before our consummation,

00:14:23.301 --> 00:14:25.780
let's have an honest conversation,

00:14:26.301 --> 00:14:29.101
then we'll build our marriage
on complete transparency.

00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:31.101
You are right.

00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:32.421
As you wish.

00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:38.740
Wang Feng!

00:14:39.981 --> 00:14:40.821
Where are you?

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.140
Wang Feng!

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.740
Where are you, Wang Feng?

00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:47.860
Wang Feng!

00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:49.500
Wang...

00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:53.421
Hexu.

00:14:53.941 --> 00:14:55.581
We have an important event today.

00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:57.301
No one may leave their rooms.

00:14:57.341 --> 00:14:58.341
Including you.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.900
I understand, Grandmother.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.540
I'm here to Father.

00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:07.461
I'm leaving.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.101
Leaving.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.620
You two betrayed me!

00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:15.020
Grandmother.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.421
I

00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:18.181
want to ask Father to feed me.

00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:32.860
This family couldn't be without me.

00:15:33.181 --> 00:15:34.620
No one here is reliable.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.660
Escort him to his room.

00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:46.792
Stepmother.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:47.981
Stepmother.

00:15:48.421 --> 00:15:48.860
Step...

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.701
Father's back?

00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:51.020
He's back.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.421
He's in stepmother's room?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.821
No idea.

00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.101
Oh, no!

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.101
They must've consummated.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.140
Hexu, Jiaoqian.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.620
Why are you so noisy?

00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:06.660
What's wrong?

00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:07.500
Nothing.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.900
Nothing.

00:16:13.301 --> 00:16:14.540
Grandmother.

00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:18.581
It's already noon.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.421
Dongyang is waking up.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.184
Why haven't Father
and Stepmother awakened?

00:16:23.101 --> 00:16:25.780
They were occupied last night.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.461
Let them rest longer.

00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:31.581
Father.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.500
Mother, good morning.

00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:46.260
You've worked hard.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.660
Where's your wife?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.660
Ms. Wang.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.100
At ease.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.621
You've worked hard.

00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:08.060
Not at all.

00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:10.661
It's the lord who worked hard.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.981
So,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.181
you opened up to each other last night?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.540
She said last night,

00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:26.421
"We'll build our marriage

00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:29.461
on complete transparency."

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.580
It's impossible.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.981
The lord has tried his best.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.661
At his advanced age,

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.661
I understand

00:17:42.221 --> 00:17:43.621
he is frail.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.580
She is right.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.141
My stamina couldn't keep up.

00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:50.100
We drank and chatted merrily.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.221
Before we ended,

00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:52.861
I cannot hold the liquor

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.060
and fell asleep.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.981
I saw a portrait in the study.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.100
But in Xue Mansion,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.901
I've never met this person.

00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:14.621
My lord,

00:18:15.381 --> 00:18:16.461
do you recognize this man?

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.621
He...

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:22.580
You know him?

00:18:27.701 --> 00:18:29.941
This wine is potent.

00:18:41.981 --> 00:18:43.221
(Something's off.)

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.141
I bet

00:18:52.221 --> 00:18:53.340
you are all hungry.

00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:54.260
Go have a meal.

00:18:54.461 --> 00:18:55.540
Come, I'll lead the way.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.340
Please, Grandmother.

00:19:00.701 --> 00:19:01.181
Lord Xue.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.701
With considerable effort,

00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:04.941
I learned
from Xue family's elderly servants

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.100
that 13 years ago,

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.680
the Xue family sent
Xue Fugui's illegitimate son Xue Youshou

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.340
away

00:19:09.701 --> 00:19:10.500
to the south.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.701
What else?

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:14.941
Tell me in detail.

00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:17.500
According to them,

00:19:18.221 --> 00:19:19.300
the Xue family

00:19:19.421 --> 00:19:21.060
has forbidden them from discussing this.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.540
Xue Youshou has never returned.

00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:26.500
The Xue family sent him so far away

00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:29.300
with annual payments
worth two decades of commoners' income.

00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:32.981
He must be the former Crown Prince.

00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:34.300
Go get him

00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:35.780
in the south.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:36.580
Understood.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.060
Xue Hexu.

00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:46.141
You said to be my family.

00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:47.981
How ridiculous!

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.221
You claimed to be my family,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.181
demanding my trust.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.260
Yet you hid
the former Crown Prince's whereabouts

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.661
from me.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.701
I truly don't know.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.621
Our entire family has never met him.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:20.941
Perhaps our Xue family

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.941
has no connection to that prince.

00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:26.621
You

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.540
expect me to trust you?

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.861
(I chose to trust you,)

00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:34.941
(yet you lie to me all along.)

00:20:40.181 --> 00:20:40.981
Sincerity...

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.780
You liar!

00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:00.421
(From today on,)

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.981
(I won't trust you anymore.)

00:21:09.421 --> 00:21:09.941
Your Majesty.

00:21:10.621 --> 00:21:12.100
I found out the former Crown Prince

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.540
likely hides in distant regions.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.820
I'm here to request your permission

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.820
to go find him.

00:21:18.141 --> 00:21:21.300
If you fail to bring me his head

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.500
this time,

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.340
I shall punish you.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.141
Yes.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.784
(Funds Pre-approved)

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.260
This is the funds for this mission,

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.461
enough for you
to get personnel and resources.

00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:44.100
The sum is exceptionally large.

00:21:44.461 --> 00:21:45.981
I may not require this much.

00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:48.540
Just take it.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.260
You serve me,

00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.540
naturally, I will treat you well.

00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:54.901
Remember, efficiency comes first.

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:57.740
Don't bother other things.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.381
If you meet trouble,

00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:01.820
I'll resolve them.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.141
After eliminating the rebel,

00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:06.861
massacre people

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.260
of Lord Dingyuan's Mansion.

00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:13.740
Your Majesty.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.740
I found out

00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:15.976
Lord Dingyuan expelled

00:22:15.976 --> 00:22:17.381
the rebel from the capital

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.300
years ago.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.661
He must've recognized his error then.

00:22:21.661 --> 00:22:22.901
Miss Feng,

00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:26.621
you seem overly protective
of your husband.

00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:28.981
I meant no offense.

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.020
Harboring the former dynasty's rebel

00:22:31.381 --> 00:22:33.540
deserves severe punishment.

00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:35.300
Yet the Lord Dingyuan's Mansion

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.020
has no one to bring back the glory

00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:37.981
to the family.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.461
I bet they'll

00:22:39.621 --> 00:22:41.020
collapse in a few years.

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:42.941
You are

00:22:43.141 --> 00:22:43.941
so noble.

00:22:44.221 --> 00:22:45.780
Don't dirt yourself

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.820
with this filth.

00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.981
You're becoming quite capable.

00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:55.300
Now you're even making decisions for me?

00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.981
If you don't want

00:23:05.181 --> 00:23:07.181
to kill people of the Xue family

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.901
and the rebel,

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:12.141
I'll dispatch others to kill them.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.621
I obey

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:18.661
your decree.

00:23:21.512 --> 00:23:26.408
(Xue Mansion)

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.621
Madam.

00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:40.181
It's late now,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.661
yet I must say something

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.421
despite displeasing you.

00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:50.981
You never met my first wife.

00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:52.260
In my heart,

00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:54.060
no one could replace her.

00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:55.461
And I

00:23:56.621 --> 00:23:58.461
never intended to remarry.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.780
Yet

00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:02.100
the fate brought us together.

00:24:04.381 --> 00:24:06.461
I know you're not
married into here willingly.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.340
When the time is right,

00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:09.540
we'll divorce

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.300
peacefully.

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.701
Tonight, let's chat honestly.

00:24:16.861 --> 00:24:17.901
Nothing else.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:22.901
Very well.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.981
Then I'll speak plainly.

00:24:26.621 --> 00:24:27.141
My lord,

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.621
where are you hiding Xue Youshou?

00:24:32.701 --> 00:24:33.461
Ms. Wang.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.181
I know no such person.

00:24:40.141 --> 00:24:41.861
The Emperor wants
to take this man's life.

00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:44.780
Grand Tutor Zhou
already knows what he looks like.

00:24:45.461 --> 00:24:46.740
Surrender him now,

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.141
and the Xue Mansion may earn merit.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.901
If the Jing'an Bureau gets him,

00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:54.661
then you'd become criminals.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.701
Grandmother or Xue Nuannuan,

00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:00.340
all of them would face execution.

00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:06.421
My lord,

00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:10.340
do you still insist?

00:25:12.584 --> 00:25:13.540
Stop it.

00:25:16.981 --> 00:25:17.421
Father!

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.300
Ms. Wang and I love each other.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.060
Please permit us.
