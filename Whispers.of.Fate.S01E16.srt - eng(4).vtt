00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.920
[Episode 16]

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.640
To refine the Mystical Frost

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.000
to such an extent...

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.350
Palace Chief Wanyu

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.710
is really something.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.680
Don't move.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.310
Plucking a lone withering plum blossom
while drunk...

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.570
Such sword essence...

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.330
is quite interesting.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740
There are also traps here.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919
We'll meet stronger Mystical Frost

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.050
as we go further.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.240
This wall of ice

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.710
is actually air

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.570
condensed by the Mystical Frost.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
In return, this ice wall

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.520
prevents the cold air from dissipating,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.829
and thus makes this place

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.290
even more bone-chilling.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.380
Palace Chief Wanyu's design

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.190
is indeed quite ingenious.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.520
That is to say,
if we break this wall of ice,

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.440
the Mystical Frost you mentioned

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.520
will be emitted.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.480
But if we don't break it,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.570
we'll be trapped here till we die.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.780
Bixiao Pearl is on you.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.520
As long as you're not injured,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.240
such coldness can't threaten your life.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.840
But what about you, Mr. Tang?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.240
Just take care of yourself.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.260
Take the pearl

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.600
and step back.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.880
When too much edge is revelaed,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.060
one become brittle and break easily.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.120
The ice sword formed by sword essence

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.410
is precisely the most vulnerable part

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.680
of this ice wall.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.130
The last one.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.360
So this is what you meant by

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.290
Mystical Frost.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.010
Mr. Tang!

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.640
Stay back.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.750
Just one move away from triumph.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.080
But it's fine.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.990
Consider it as

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.320

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.250
I wait for them to come out and greet me.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.270
Tang Lici.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.260
You're truly audacious,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.390
daring to return here to meet your end.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.450
Steward Bi.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.130
Long time no see.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.000
I, Tang Lici,

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.600
request an audience with the chief
of Biluo Palace.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.460
The Palace Chief wants to see you.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.050
Mr. Tang.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.240
Chi and Shen

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.830
are still freezing outside.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.830
Shouldn't we ask the Palace Chief
to let them in first?

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.920
Biluo Palace doesn't welcome outsiders.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.120
Chi Yun and the others

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.140
might have to

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.120
endure the cold a bit longer.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.010
But don't worry.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.560
Their martial skills are profound.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.730
If the Biluo Palace

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.550
doesn't welcome outsiders,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.440
we...

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.180
You are criminals.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.910
Biluo Palace is untainted
by the mundane world.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.240
Please change your clothes first.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.170
The Palace Chief

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.360
will personally interrogate both of you.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.040
This way.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.200
I, Tang Lici,

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.620
pay my respects to Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.750
I, Shei,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.430
pay my respects to the Palace Chief.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.620
You seem surprised.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.810
What surprises you more now is

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.630
how I could know this.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.940
I just didn't expect that...

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.480
That the Chief of Biluo Palace

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.340
would be blind.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.480
I apologize.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.120
Don't feel sorry for me.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.800
I'm used to it.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.430
I've been blind since childhood

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.550
but mastered a unique skill.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.760
I cannot see objects

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.780
but I can perceive energy.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.870
I can also sense

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.320
subtle changes in light.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.320
Most remarkably,

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.060
I can sense others' emotional states,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.840
doubt,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.940
suspicion,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.050
and fear.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.670
Any intense emotions,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.000
I can feel them all.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.320
You have a gentle
and straightforward nature.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320
So naturally,

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.000
I can easily read you.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.440
Right now,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.040
you should be more concerned

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.960
about your friend.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.660
You knew I would certainly see you.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:29.840
Of course.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.550
Four years ago,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.080
the Immortal Crystal Coffin
of the former Palace Chief

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.240
was stolen by me.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.230
If you don't see me,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.520
how will you recover the coffin?

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.240
Even the mighty Yique Yinyang

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.100
can face moments of desperation.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.480
You want to return the coffin

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.880
in exchange for Biluo Palace's protection.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.380
Biluo Palace's intelligence

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.840
travels remarkably fast.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.950
I have several friends

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.310
waiting outside.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.270
I request that the Palace Chief

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.730
allow them to enter first.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.400
Everyone knows

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.950
Biluo Palace doesn't welcome outsiders.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.440
Stealing the former Palace Chief's coffin

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.720
is already a deadly offence.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.520
Yet you still want to negotiate
with Biluo Palace?

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.350
Don't you

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.880
want to properly

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.830
bury your father?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.480
You dare threaten the Palace Chief?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.510
Biluo Palace

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.600
never welcomes outsiders.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.830
I'm afraid even if we wait here

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.290
for three days and nights,

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.780
they still won't open the door.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.460
Has Tang Lici really died,

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.110
or was he swept away

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.600
by the Celestial River glacier

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.800
and couldn't return?

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.110
I've been saying all along

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.970
that we should look for Foxy Tang.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.480
Master Cheng,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.070
I'll be taking my leave now.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.010
Where are you going to find him?

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.550
Along the lower reaches, of course.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.070
Chi.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.520
-Junior.
-How about...

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.810
What did you just call him?

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:53.490
Bandit Chi.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.350
Let's stay here for the night.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.750
If Thief Tang hasn't returned
by tomorrow,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.310
we can look for him then.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.280
Very good.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.920
Go over there and recite

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.850
Rule number 11 of Camellia Island.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.030
Recite it 20 times.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.800
Say it out loud.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.310
Senior.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.030
30 times.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.000
Rule number 11 of Camellia Island.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.920
Good and evil cannot coexist.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.580
One must maintain integrity.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.650
If encountered...

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.240
Encountered...

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.310
Yu Furen?

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.020
What are you saying?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.720
Senior.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.300
Someone's coming.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.280
Master Cheng.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.210
Yique Yinyang's accomplice?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.830
Where is the criminal, Tang Lici?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.070
He fell into the Celestial River

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.240
and disappeared without a trace.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.490
The water of Celestial River
is freezing cold,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.210
making it impossible to search underwater.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.400
If you can't find

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.750
who you're looking for here,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.790
you might as well go down the mountain

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.880
and search along the river.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.940
If that's the case,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.350
why are you still lingering here,
Island Master?

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.550
I'm here to visit the Chief
of Biluo Palace.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.160
Then why are those two

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.620
also standing guard here?

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.460
Everyone.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.880
The Yique Yinyang, Tang Lici,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.740
have vanished.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.790
Why don't we

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.930
stay where we are

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.020
and take a rest?

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.350
Keep Master Cheng company

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.750
and wait here for a while.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.350
Biluo Palace has at least

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.550
fifty-three methods

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.160
to make you surrender the crystal coffin.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.340
I don't think

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.810
you can last until the sixth one.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.280
Palace Chief may have ten thousand ways

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.240
to kill me.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.030
But among them,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.290
there is absolutely no method

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.060
that will allow your father

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.480
to rest in peace.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.600
You're truly capable.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.640
Four years ago,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.710
you stole the crystal coffin
from Biluo Palace.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.480
Now even the Mystical Frost of Mount Maoya

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.610
cannot contain you.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.880
However,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.030
do you think I would believe

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.720
a fugitive hunted by

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.980
everyone in the world?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.200
Outside these walls,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.790
there is the Master of Camellia Island

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.000
from the Sword Alliance, Cheng Yunpao,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.200
who is hunting for me.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.960
Even though Biluo Palace remains secluded
from the world

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.180
and stays neutral among the good and evil,

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.880
regardless of whether you intend

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.240
to protect me

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.510
or punish me,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.350
shouldn't you

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.590
first give the Sword Alliance

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.520
an explanation?

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.240
You're negotiating with me now?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.030
I only hope

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.200
you can make a decision quickly,
Palace Chief.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.860
Because...

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.310
Time is running out.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.520
The Sword Alliance and Fengliu Shop

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.000
have encountered each other
at the entrance of Biluo Palace.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.310
I'm afraid

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.240
your days of staying out of jianghu

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.850
are coming to an end.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.740
You're Xifang Tao,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.350
from Fengliu Shop.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:25.830
Master Cheng,

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.990
you still remember me?

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.510
May I ask if Mr. Tang

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.200
has already entered Biluo Palace?

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.730
Why waste so many words on him?

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.720
Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.590
Kill them all!

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.170
Comes ashore once every ten years,

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.630
the camellias enter reincarnation.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.620
Who am I fighting against?

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.000
What are you all standing there for?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.680
Kill them!

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.270
Fucui.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.670
A single tune can halt the killing.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.880
Do you dare to attack?

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:21.590
If we show

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.320
even a hint of fighting spirit,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.200
this peaceful melody

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960
will transform into Sound Killing.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.000
Tang Lici.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.510
So you are here after all.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.240
Foxy Tang.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.850
You didn't freeze to death?

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.980
You even got inside?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.400
Well, that's great.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.030
Quick, ask the Palace Chief
to open the gate

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.830
and let us in.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.660
Biluo Palace has formed an alliance
with Tang Lici.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.660
What should we do?

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.020
Biluo Palace has always remained neutral.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.510
We cannot allow conflict to happen
in front of us

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.140
and just stand by doing nothing.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.590
You deliberately brought both forces

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.550
to Biluo Palace.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.400
Then you openly helped the Sword Alliance
with your qin music.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.240
This way, Fengliu Shop

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.310
will surely believe
that I have allied with you

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.920
and the Sword Alliance.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.750
So you can naturally force me

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.480
to get involved in this matter.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.030
By order of the Palace Chief,

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.160
Master Cheng and other member

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.960
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.090
are invited as guests to Biluo Palace.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.480
Is Biluo Palace

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.510
trying to go against

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.280
the Fengliu Shop?

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.340
I advise you.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.240
Before making any threats,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.240
first consider your own abilities.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.090
Beneath the Celestial River,

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.110
there are plenty of corpses.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.680
Bastard!

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.480
Stay if you dare!

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.450
Just wait.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.350
You still owe me two slaps.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.920
Yu.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.920
Come inside with us.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.460
Tang Lici.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:19.960
For the murder of my master,

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.220
we will never coexist.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.000
I, Yu Furen,

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.040
would rather die than accept charity.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.000
Today,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.970
even if it costs my life,

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.270
Sword King City will stand in the way

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.200
of Fengliu Shop.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.680
Do you know how much
your martial arts skills

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.280
are inferior to Tang Lici's?

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.300
Someone who truly wants revenge

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320
will endure pain,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.880
live like an insect,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.040
crawl through the mud,

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.410
and squirm to survive,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.480
to look for a chance
to crawl into the elephant's ear

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.800
and give it a fatal blow.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.430
At least

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.820
make your enemies suffer.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.840
Shen is doing this for your own good.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.770
Let's go inside.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.400
No need.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.580
Yu.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.410
Wait for me.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.160
Miss Xifang.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.480
In this situation,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.160
would you prefer to leave on your own,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.960
or shall I escort you out myself?

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.040
Mr. Tang.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.280
Since our hasty parting last time,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.680
I have missed you dearly.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.720
I wonder if Mr. Tang

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.050
stills remember me?

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.880
Miss Xifang.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.020
You left a deep impression on me

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.110
and made me think of you constantly.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.110
I dare not forget.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.800
Mr. Tang, you have extraordinary talents.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.830
You've even managed

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.790
to make Biluo Palace,
which never welcomes outsiders,

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.250
made an exception for you.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.850
I dare to ask.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.080
Is your request for us to leave

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.540
Palace Chief Wanyu's intention?

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.280
What do you want to say?

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.350
I am the Palace Chief of the West Palace
of Fengliu Shop,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.190
Xifang Tao.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.320
This is Fucui, the Palace Chief
of the East Palace.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.780
On behalf of Fengliu Shop,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.690
we request an audience
with Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.410
We kindly ask Palace Chief Wanyu

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.140
to make an exception for us too.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.440
You are quite graceful.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.680
To refuse you

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.380
would seem discourteous.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.770
However, the rules of Biluo Palace

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.030
must still be observed.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.920
Of course.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.610
No fighting within the palace.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.480
Violators will be imprisoned.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.160
Killers will be executed.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.140
I'll remember that.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.610
This way, Miss.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.830
Mr. Tang.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.390
Do you think

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480
you can really manipulate

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.790
my thoughts?

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.710
How can you, Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.440
be under my control?

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.440
A worthy opponent

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.430
makes the game interesting,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.650
don't you agree?

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.750
This is the Xuantian Rope

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.480
that leads to the Biluo Palace.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.700
If you fall from the cliff,

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.350
there's no chance of survival.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.360
Those who lack confidence
in their lightness skills,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.020
please wait at the front hall.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.790
What was your purpose

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.480
in telling me all those things

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.590
just now?

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:54.920
Because...

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.980
I like the fire of hatred in your eyes.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.130
It is just like mine.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:16.870
Everyone.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160
This way, please.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.030
Why are these scoundrels

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.830
also allowed into Biluo Palace?

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.940
The Palace Chief has invited them as well,

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.670
so they are just like all of you,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.050
guests of Biluo Palace.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.570
It's getting late.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.160
I invite you all to stay
at the Zixiao Courtyard

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.960
for the night.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.920
The fellow jianghu members

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.980
who couldn't cross the Xuantian Rope

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.240
have been accommodated in shelters
in the city.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.200
Regarding tonight's rules,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.600
I will only say this once,

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.330
so please listen carefully.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.120
One.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.920
No killing is allowed within Biluo Palace.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.850
If anyone kills,

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.070
it will be considered an offense
against Biluo Palace.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.330
They will be executed.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.790
Two.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.440
Tonight, there will be people

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.030
patrolling in the Zixiao Courtyard.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.750
During the patrol,

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.440
no fighting should be discovered.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.300
If discovered,

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.160
you will be imprisoned.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:02.950
Three.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.950
Early tomorrow morning,

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.830
the Palace Chief will meet

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.290
with one person among you.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.530
Who will the Palace Chief meet?

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.480
Who will it be?

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.610
The Palace Chief will decide tomorrow.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.330
Fighting is forbidden in the palace.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.000
But throwing a punch is fine, right?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.460
If you lay hands on people,

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.180
you must repay double.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.270
If I slap him once,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.780
and get two slaps in return,

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.510
is that fine?

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.440
That's two slaps already.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.370
No more hitting.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.870
Chi, are you alright?

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.200
That slap just now

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.660
was what you owed me.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.750
What are you trying to prove?

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.590
Biluo Palace remains untainted
by worldly dust.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.810
Before entering the palace,

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.410
please change your clothes.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.150
Male guests, please follow me.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:17.310
Miss,

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.460
female guests are to head this way
for clothes changing.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.830
Yu, let's go.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.290
This is your residence.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.650
Where are our other companions?

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.070
I'm only responsible for guiding you here.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.400
Each room is arranged for two people only.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.550
Why?

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.480
Steward Bi instructed us

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.360
to arrange everyone this way.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.050
Wait for me in the room.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.390
I'll go find the others.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.780
Thank you for escorting us, Steward.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.740
Where are the others?

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.680
They have seven people

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.910
while you only have five.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.310
This seems unfair to you.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.400
Hence, Young Master asked me
to deliver a few words.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.810
Wanyu Yuedan.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.000
If you have something to say,
come out and say it yourself.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.640
Sending a servant to deliver messages?

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.700
Are you looking down on the Fengliu Shop?

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.160
Because of your rudeness,

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.960
I'll withhold some information.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.350
You!

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:12.410
Cui,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.300
could you please be more respectful?

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.120
I apologize.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.570
What did you want to tell us, Steward?

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.270
The Palace Chief doesn't just
look at results,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.640
but also at your performance.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.070
You two

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.570
should find your companions quickly.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.750
Thank you, Palace Chief, for the advice.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.410
Although it's missing a line,

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.000
it's sufficient.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.370
No, what do you mean?

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.420
Have you forgotten

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.110
that we came here

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.260
to kill Tang Lici and his people?

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.000
Outside the city,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.110
your hesitation was tolerable.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.570
But now,

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.030
we've entered Biluo Palace.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:51.350
No,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.320
can't you tell?

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.920
Tang Lici and Wanyu Yuedan

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.380
are all working together.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.020
What are we doing here?

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:57.740
To die?

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.470
Fucui.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.280
Who told you

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.070
that Tang Lici

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.560
and Wanyu Yuedan are allies?

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.600
How are they not allies?

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.190
The two of them

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.710
were standing together on the city wall.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.860
They even let them in.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.320
If they truly were allies,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.510
why did

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:16.960
Wanyu Yuedan

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.320
let us in?

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.389
Oh, Fucui.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.030
Haven't you realized

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.440
Tang Lici's plot yet?

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.400
Plot?

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.920
Impossible.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.550
There's no plot.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.360
Wanyu Yuedan opened the gates

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.230
just to help Tang Lici

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.360
and his people.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.400
If Palace Chief Wanyu

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.000
had saved Chi and the others,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:01.440
why did he

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.670
separate us?

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:03.850
Perhaps

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.590
he doesn't want to be manipulated by me.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.620
Mr. Tang,

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.930
you're being too reckless.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.000
What?

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.330
Aren't you used to it yet?

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.070
Then

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.580
what should we do next?

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.830
Let's wait for Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:20.910
to find us first.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.220
There are many rooms here.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.330
Not only do they all look the same,

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.330
but they're scattered everywhere.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.650
Can Chi Yun

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.140
and the others find us?

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.730
Shen Langhun

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.860
is an expert at stealth and searching.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.840
In Sword King City,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.300
he can move around freely.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.760
They could possibly

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.000
be at our door already.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.440
Look.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.200
I'm right, aren't I?

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.880
Foxy Tang.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.550
What do we need to do now?

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.920
What's even going on?

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.420
Before we do anything,

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.320
keep this safe first.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.960
What is this?

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.040
Jade Toad Scar-Soothing Gel.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.070
For external use.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.440
Good brother.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.900
The story

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.960
goes back to

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.960
after the battle at Sword King City.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.190
After I took Yu Qifeng's

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.840
Westwind Slashing Wildfire attack,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.240
Master Puzhu rescued me.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.940
It was just at

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.000
that bamboo house where you found me.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.130
What kind of agreement?

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.490
Biluo Palace.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.170
As long as you let me take my leave,

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.010
I, Tang,

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:58.870
would find a way

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.670
to introduce the Sword Alliance

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.340
to form an alliance with Biluo Palace

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.600
against Fengliu Shop.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:05.540
Years ago, the Sword Alliance

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.080
have sent people to contact them,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.140
but they all returned empty-handed,

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.690
not even getting to meet

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.850
Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.740
How will you make the introduction?

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.600
Four years ago,

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.630
I stole the Immortal Crystal Coffin

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.540
of the former Palace Chief

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.830
from the Biluo Palace.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.210
If Palace Chief Wanyu

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.570
wants to retrieve his ancestor's coffin,

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:24.840
he'll have no choice

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.920
but to see me.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.520
Fengliu Shop has deep connections

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.560
and many spies.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.280
If the news of the Sword Alliance

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.000
planning to unite

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.730
with Biluo Palace were to leak,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.270
Fengliu Shop would certainly intervene.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.450
They might even

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.630
send people

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.800
to beat us to it

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.360
and try to form an alliance with them.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.150
I am now

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.080
a suspect in Yique Yinyang's case.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.670
The Sword Alliance

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.800
can take this chance

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.650
of me heading to the Biluo Palace

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.520
to send envoys

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.390
pretending to pursue me.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.030
This will

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.010
throw others off the scent.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.800
Once I reach the Biluo Palace,

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.320
I, Tang,

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.110
will find a way to introduce the Emissary

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.760
to Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.210
At that time,

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.070
it will depend on

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.320
whether the Sword Alliance has a way

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.790
to convince Palace Chief Wanyu

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.990
to join forces against Fengliu Shop.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.800
That's right.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.550
For all these years, Biluo Palace

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.070
has avoided all contact
with people of the jianghu.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:15.960
I see they've been living

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.820
quite the life.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.230
How can you be so sure

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.570
they'll cooperate with the Sword Alliance?

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.550
Because

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.760
the former Palace Chief's
Immortal Crystal Coffin

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.510
is empty.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:29.410
What?

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.090
As per your instructions, Palace Chief,

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.760
the guests have been settled,
two per room,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.550
throughout the Zixiao Courtyard.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.680
We will not be buried

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.840
until we return to our homeland.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.990
The Wanyu lineage

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.230
must returning to the Central Plains.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.030
Palace Chief.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.540
Yique Yinyang is dead.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.900
The former dynasty has fallen.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.490
The Wanyu lineage
returning to the Central Plains

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.090
is just a matter of decision.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.640
As for whether we'll cooperate
with Fengliu Shop

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.440
or ally with the Sword Alliance,

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.970
that depends on their performance.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.690
As heaven moves, the stars follow,

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.360
like shadows following form.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.730
When you found the coffin was empty,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.800
you guessed

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.280
the former Palace Chief

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.940
wanted to return to his roots.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.560
After meeting Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.010
I became even more certain

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.090
of my suspicions.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.440
Don't you

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.530
want to

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.230
bury your father?

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.440
You're even trying to threaten me?

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.480
Hey, Foxy Tang,

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.760
what's going on

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.110
in that head of yours?

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.960
How can you come up

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.560
with such convoluted ideas?

00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.990
It's just that

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.750
the path back to the Central Plains

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.540
isn't limited to just one route.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.840
But Wanyu Yuedan
has brought Fengliu Shop

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.300
into Biluo Palace as well.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.360
Does he want to work with Fengliu Shop?

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.370
Winners become kings, losers are outlaws.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.360
Rather than joining the side
that will fail,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.090
Why don't you

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.860
bet on the right winner?

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.400
Biluo Palace

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.510
has always been strictly managed

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.610
and doesn't allow outsiders in.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.800
What does he want to do here?

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.550
And how can he guarantee

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.110
that Biluo Palace

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.090
will welcome him with open doors?

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.480
And why did Cheng Yunpao

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.320
come after him?

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.000
Should we notify

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.530
that stubborn Cheng Yunpao

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.030
to pull some strings

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.960
or do something?

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.000
So, Senior

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.010
didn't come to arrest Mr. Tang?

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.010
To prevent leaks,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.580
only the Sword Master,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:09.380
Master Puzhu,

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.580
and I know about this.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.360
You're too honest.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.390
I was afraid you'll give us away.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.510
Then why did you

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.980
try to capture Mr. Tang outside the city?

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:18.880
With him captured,

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.440
we could bring him to Biluo Palace

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.700
and use him as leverage

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.110
to gain an audience
with Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:24.670
This way,

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.070
it would be more legitimate.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.850
Then why would Mr. Tang run away?

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:28.710
Did he even run?

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.750
He was just traveling with me.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.420
Cheng Yunpao's goal

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.930
was never Tang Lici at all.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.590
Tang Lici was just a pretext,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.990
providing a pathway

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.290
while he sneaks in unnoticed.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.820
Allowing Cheng Yunpao into Biluo Palace.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:44.940
is the real objective.
