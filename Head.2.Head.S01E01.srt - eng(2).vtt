J.

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:46.632
J.

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:50.077
J.

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:53.325
J!

00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:56.765
J, dear son.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:01.793
Wake up.

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:03.195
Isn’t it your first day of the new semester?

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:04.798
Yes, Mom.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.993
I’m awake.

00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:09.010
Then get out of bed.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.122
Up!

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:13.468
Ouch, Mom.

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:15.297
Stop hitting me like I’m still a little kid.

00:01:15.297 --> 00:01:16.814
Go take a shower.

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:19.110
Your Chef Daddy already made breakfast.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.994
And don’t think you can nap in the bathroom,
or I’ll come in and smack you again.

00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:25.569
Yes, ma’am.

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:27.144
Up!

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:36.786
What the heck was that dream?

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:40.059
Mom, I’m off.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:42.085
Jinn, wait!

00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:45.590
Come home this Friday after class

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.380
so we can go make merit
for your birthday on Saturday morning.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.692
Can we not go to the temple?

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:52.736
Every time I see monks, I feel uneasy,
like I’m coming down with a fever.

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:53.790
You wicked one!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.546
Don’t badmouth religious figures.

00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:57.336
I’m only joking, Gorgeous.

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:01.805
Can I get a chocolate cake this year, though?

00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:02.562
Goodness!

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:04.721
How can you ask for so little?

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:05.550
And a car?

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.044
No way!

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:08.610
I’m this close to taking that car back.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.967
Don’t even joke about a new one.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:11.289
Fine, I don’t want one, Gorgeous.

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:12.870
Drive safely, okay?

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.256
Yes, ma’am. Bye-bye.

00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:16.984
And don’t ever go to the racetrack
to race cars again.

00:02:16.984 --> 00:02:18.485
I’m not listening. I don’t hear anything.

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:20.161
Be safe, Jinn!

00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:41.759
What, honking for your dad?

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:42.401
Huh?

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:44.113
Those honks were for your dad?

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.145
My dad’s inside. Why would I honk for him?

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.681
Tell your dad to
put his son right back in his balls

00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:54.180
so he stops bothering people.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.602
What a freaking pain in the ass!

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.439
What are you smiling at?

00:02:58.168 --> 00:02:59.077
What the hell are you smiling at?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.429
You get worked up so easily.

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.274
Careful not to get
your blood pressure up, dear.

00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:05.721
You jerk!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.693
Hey!

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:08.678
- Get off me.
- Damn it.

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:09.790
I’ll get back at you.

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:11.479
I’ll come for you.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.606
Asshole.

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:14.657
You lost again today,

00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:16.523
Nong Jinn.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.466
I’m not your junior.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:19.709
I was even born before you. Don’t forget.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.571
Yeah, by like seven minutes.

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:22.890
Are you so proud?

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.613
If we’re talking height,

00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:32.319
I should be your senior.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.685
You’re just five centimeters taller.

00:04:33.942 --> 00:04:35.293
Don’t brag so much.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.915
You’re so childish.

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:42.246
Says the guy who brags
about being seven minutes older.

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:43.385
Not childish at all.

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.575
Have you ever counted how many years
you’ve been getting on my nerves?

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:48.000
Why would I?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.234
Well, I don’t know.

00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:51.347
You’re always following me around.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.383
I’m starting to think…

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:57.991
you’ve got a secret crush on me.

00:04:59.877 --> 00:05:02.448
Are you sure
I’m the one with the secret crush?

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.323
I know you’re a boy, Jerome.

00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:08.143
But why can’t two guys get married?

00:05:08.143 --> 00:05:10.031
I still like you, Jerome.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:12.295
Males have to be with females.

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:13.249
Bleh!

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:16.233
Jinn likes boys!

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:17.413
Asshole!

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:20.100
When will you stop bringing up
that story from when I was seven?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.850
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.472
Huh?

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.988
Answer me.

00:05:23.717 --> 00:05:26.141
Hi. You have morning classes?

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.807
That’s right.

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:27.759
Do you have morning classes too, J?

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:28.371
That’s right.

00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:30.278
Two-faced jerk.

00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:35.188
I’ve gotta go. My friend’s already left.

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:36.895
- Bye-bye.
- Of course.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.374
Shit.

00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:16.253
- What?
- What?

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:19.832
Look, the duo arrives together again.

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:23.818
You two must be best buds.

00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:26.206
Best buds, my ass.

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:27.871
Do I look like I want to come with him?

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:45.574
Van.

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:46.765
How do I look?

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.731
Handsome as always, dude.

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:50.014
This again, guys?

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.081
Don’t you ever get tired of fighting?

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.281
Nope.

00:07:54.203 --> 00:07:56.178
It’s hella fun.

00:08:04.002 --> 00:08:05.197
Have you heard?

00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:06.402
Yes, I have.

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.461
So, what are you gonna do?

00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:10.338
Want payback?

00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:10.999
No.

00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:15.298
If he wants to eat my leftovers that bad,
let him.

00:08:16.155 --> 00:08:19.127
Besides, I was kind of tired of Beam anyway.

00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:20.761
I was just thinking of dating someone new.

00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:25.007
But you once told me
you were serious about this one…

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.206
You two are too alike—

00:08:30.592 --> 00:08:33.799
born on the same day, same taste in people.

00:08:33.906 --> 00:08:34.996
Same taste?

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:36.579
My type’s always been like this.

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:39.172
He’s the one who keeps
hitting on whoever I like.

00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:41.798
You also keep trying to
beat him at everything.

00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:45.065
You guys are addicted to
competing with each other.

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:46.396
Look what he’s done to me first.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.493
This is your problem, dude.

00:08:48.664 --> 00:08:49.961
You’re easily triggered.

00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:51.134
That’s why you’re always at a disadvantage.

00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:52.436
See what J does?

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.322
He competes with ease, stays calm.

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:58.564
That’s why he keeps winning.

00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:04.528
He’s done it again.

00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:05.749
Right? He’s so hot, it’s cheating.

00:09:05.856 --> 00:09:07.866
You always get whoever you want.

00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:09.706
Just walk up and ask for their number.

00:09:09.963 --> 00:09:10.762
How hard can it be?

00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:26.297
Why did you do it?

00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:28.272
Do what?

00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:29.932
You don’t even like guys.

00:09:30.747 --> 00:09:31.956
Are you just trying to mess with me?

00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:33.608
My type changes all the time.

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:35.701
Don’t whine just because you can’t beat me.

00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:42.749
You chicken!

00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:48.382
J, you bastard!

00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:49.632
Ouch.

00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:52.464
Ow! Mom!

00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:54.293
- Ouch!
- Don’t move.

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.746
Jan, just stop it.

00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:58.187
The kids were just playing.

00:09:58.187 --> 00:09:59.107
I’m sure Jinn didn’t mean it.

00:09:59.107 --> 00:09:59.763
Right, dear?

00:09:59.763 --> 00:10:00.715
Yes, Auntie Jen.

00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:01.982
Please help me.

00:10:01.982 --> 00:10:03.563
Don’t sweet-talk Auntie Jen.

00:10:03.563 --> 00:10:05.716
No one can help you.

00:10:05.716 --> 00:10:07.511
What is this? You two grew up together.

00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:09.196
Your houses are opposite each other.

00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:10.440
You go to the same school.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.565
Why are you always fighting?

00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:13.851
Just tell me why.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.600
What if J got seriously injured?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.892
How am I going to compensate Auntie Jen?

00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:18.982
J’s thick-skinned.

00:10:18.982 --> 00:10:20.206
A little punch won’t kill him.

00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:21.631
Ouch.

00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:23.701
Mom! It hurts!

00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:25.071
Auntie Jan, it’s okay.

00:10:25.393 --> 00:10:26.871
Jinn probably didn’t mean it.

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:28.198
Aw, my dear J.

00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:30.659
See how sweet he is?

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:32.525
You were going to tell my mom anyway.

00:10:32.718 --> 00:10:34.627
Take off your mask and stop saying

00:10:34.627 --> 00:10:37.215
“Auntie Jan, Auntie Jan, he didn’t mean…”

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:38.392
Auntie Jan, huh?

00:10:38.392 --> 00:10:40.545
If you hadn’t hit me,
none of this would have happened.

00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:41.361
You started it.

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:42.736
What? What did I do?

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:43.766
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:45.962
- You’re both at fault.
- You’re both at fault.

00:10:47.462 --> 00:10:49.981
Hey, all you do is fight.

00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.883
You’re grown now, you know?

00:10:51.883 --> 00:10:54.208
You’ve been at each other’s throats
since you were little.

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:55.680
When are you gonna stop, sons?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.352
I should just lock you two together
in a room until you learn.

00:11:00.438 --> 00:11:01.296
No, Mom.

00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:02.068
Who would want to live with him?

00:11:02.068 --> 00:11:02.718
Good idea.

00:11:03.618 --> 00:11:05.641
Ouch, it hurts!

00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.875
Do you want to be whipped, too?

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:08.969
Go shower and go to bed.

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.198
You’ve got school in the morning.

00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:10.892
Yes, Mom.

00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:13.355
I’m gonna get my payback.

00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:14.595
There’s nothing to pay.

00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:15.939
Goodbye, ma’am.

00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:16.891
Hey, Jinn!

00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:17.582
Where are you going?

00:11:17.582 --> 00:11:18.487
I’m not done with you yet.

00:11:18.487 --> 00:11:20.236
Go shower and go to bed.

00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:23.331
- These two.
- These two.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.446
Master of two faces, I’d say.

00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:26.796
He’s never been sincere with anyone.

00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:28.040
He just wants to sleep with them.

00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:30.527
You two are evil just the same.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.284
I’m clearly much better.

00:11:32.777 --> 00:11:34.470
Whatever. I don’t care.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:43.015
Pull it out first.

00:11:45.694 --> 00:11:47.323
Why do you keep staring at Jinn?

00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:49.047
Trying to bug him again?

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:50.946
Who’s staring?

00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:52.942
I’m just looking around.

00:11:53.435 --> 00:11:56.629
And for the record, I never start the fights.

00:11:56.972 --> 00:11:57.963
He’s always the one who picks on me first.

00:11:57.963 --> 00:11:58.592
Are you sure?

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:01.137
I see you start it every time.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.990
Recently, you two were
even hitting on the same guy.

00:12:03.783 --> 00:12:04.500
What was his name, Beam?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.701
Well, he chose me.

00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:07.742
What was I supposed to do?

00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:08.826
And now what?

00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:13.787
Seriously, is Beam really your type?

00:12:14.237 --> 00:12:16.624
Or do you just like him
because Jinn liked him first?

00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:18.411
You go after whoever Jinn’s into,

00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:20.981
and once you get them,
you dump them right after.

00:12:21.388 --> 00:12:23.514
Do you want to beat him that badly?

00:12:24.972 --> 00:12:25.806
I don’t know.

00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:30.728
I guess the people Jinn likes
just seem more interesting than others.

00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.531
(What the f*ck are you looking at, asshole?)

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.498
(Looking at an asshole.)

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.281
Move.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.209
Are you mad at me about Beam?

00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:12.453
No.

00:13:12.624 --> 00:13:13.244
Oh?

00:13:13.244 --> 00:13:14.334
But I hate you.

00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:18.050
With or without Beam, I always hate you.

00:13:18.243 --> 00:13:20.826
So stay out of my life

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:23.528
before my patience runs out
and I punch you in the face.

00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:37.224
If it’s not about Beam, then…

00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:43.390
you’re jealous of me?

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:54.186
Jealous, my ass.

00:13:54.186 --> 00:13:54.969
I hate you.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.585
I hate Jerome! I hate Jerome!

00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:30.522
Jinn!

00:14:31.272 --> 00:14:34.456
Does someone like you ever get serious with anyone?

00:14:34.627 --> 00:14:36.362
How about I get serious with you?

00:14:47.392 --> 00:14:48.560
Are you sure you looked everywhere?

00:14:49.077 --> 00:14:50.410
You really didn’t take it by mistake?

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.102
Yeah, I can’t find it.

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:01.801
Oh, shit.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.913
What are you looking for, Nong Jinn?

00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:09.333
I gotta go.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.908
Is this what you’re looking for?

00:15:18.014 --> 00:15:19.853
I was generous enough to keep it for you.

00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:22.956
A thank you would be really nice.

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:25.362
Someone like you would do that for me?

00:15:26.089 --> 00:15:26.697
Give it back!

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:29.138
J!

00:15:50.154 --> 00:15:51.323
Taking advantage of me?

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.179
It’s not good to be so handsy.

00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:56.023
Then give it back.

00:15:57.942 --> 00:15:58.672
Ha!

00:16:01.657 --> 00:16:02.259
Hey!

00:16:06.682 --> 00:16:07.417
Shit.

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:09.892
Holy shit.

00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:12.210
My car key.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.596
Climb up there and get it, J.

00:16:29.247 --> 00:16:30.764
If you hadn’t tried to snatch it,
it wouldn’t have ended up there.

00:16:30.764 --> 00:16:31.783
So you’re blaming me?

00:16:32.664 --> 00:16:34.348
You’re the one who stole it.

00:16:34.348 --> 00:16:35.475
The hell I stole it.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.850
You dropped it in the bathroom,
so I picked it up for you.

00:16:39.094 --> 00:16:40.531
If you really meant well,

00:16:40.952 --> 00:16:42.323
why didn’t you give it back right away?

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.665
See?

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:47.169
You can’t think of more bullshit.

00:16:47.475 --> 00:16:49.728
Wow, you’re just—

00:16:51.757 --> 00:16:52.257
Hey.

00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:53.313
Hey!

00:17:02.157 --> 00:17:04.340
Aim better.

00:17:09.687 --> 00:17:10.792
Ouch, J!

00:17:10.792 --> 00:17:12.461
Watch me. Watch and learn.

00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:13.084
Yeah, do it yourself.

00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:13.774
Watch.

00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:20.951
What now?

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:23.718
We might need a different strategy.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.765
What?

00:17:27.162 --> 00:17:28.313
Stand on your toes.

00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:29.937
I am standing on my toes!

00:17:30.492 --> 00:17:31.224
Hurry up.

00:17:31.224 --> 00:17:32.663
Hurry? Why don’t you do it?

00:17:32.663 --> 00:17:34.301
Just pick it. Stop turning and talking to me.

00:17:34.301 --> 00:17:36.055
Damn. You’re taller, but your heart’s tiny.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.391
Afraid of heights? What a chicken!

00:17:38.827 --> 00:17:41.148
Gosh! J!

00:17:41.474 --> 00:17:42.401
What the hell are you laughing at?

00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:43.184
It’s not funny.

00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:49.257
I got it. I got it.

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:53.572
We did it.

00:17:53.802 --> 00:17:55.536
We did it.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.250
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18:12.868 --> 00:18:14.286
- Yuck.
- Ew.

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:20.067
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:21.918
Geez! You’re bleeding.

00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:26.625
It’s your cheek’s fault.

00:18:26.893 --> 00:18:29.086
Not only does it smell bad,
but it also injured me.

00:18:31.824 --> 00:18:33.013
How did you know it smells bad?

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:34.535
Did you sniff it?

00:18:36.228 --> 00:18:37.796
As if I wanted to sniff it.

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:39.800
Here, get this.

00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:44.196
Come and get it.

00:18:45.996 --> 00:18:47.134
Damn you, J.

00:19:08.927 --> 00:19:11.228
If it weren’t for you,
I’d be sleeping on the street tonight.

00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:14.286
Your girlfriend kicks you out every other day.
Don’t you get used to it by now?

00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:20.094
And stop acting like
you don’t have a home to go back to.

00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:21.198
Well, my home is far.

00:19:21.581 --> 00:19:23.450
It can’t compare to
your condo near campus.

00:19:24.675 --> 00:19:26.223
Behave yourself, will you?

00:19:26.414 --> 00:19:29.042
One partner a month doesn’t make you cool.

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:30.192
It just makes you an asshole.

00:19:30.613 --> 00:19:31.552
Copy that, Father.

00:19:31.552 --> 00:19:32.239
I got it.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.891
Seriously though, does someone like you
ever get serious with anyone?

00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:40.925
How about I get serious with you?

00:19:40.925 --> 00:19:42.104
You jerk.

00:19:42.468 --> 00:19:43.920
I hate it when you joke like that.

00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:44.834
Why?

00:19:45.772 --> 00:19:49.243
Afraid you’ll end up falling for me, babe?

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.071
Go shower before I kick you out.

00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:55.787
Fine.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.879
Kiss, kiss, baby.

00:20:00.889 --> 00:20:01.523
Ow!

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:03.989
Stop spouting nonsense.

00:20:03.989 --> 00:20:04.979
Kiss, kiss.

00:20:27.504 --> 00:20:28.101
Watch it.

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:29.263
Damn it.

00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:32.058
Shit.

00:20:52.196 --> 00:20:52.748
Jinn!

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:05.576
What the?!

00:21:29.057 --> 00:21:30.527
I think this one should be a turtleneck.

00:21:30.527 --> 00:21:34.886
Why do we have to
make clothes again this semester?!

00:21:35.383 --> 00:21:37.511
Gosh, I’m exhausted!

00:21:40.593 --> 00:21:41.441
You’re studying fashion.

00:21:41.671 --> 00:21:43.133
What the hell else would you do
if not make clothes?

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:43.843
Sing?

00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:45.307
I’m just tired, okay?

00:21:45.556 --> 00:21:48.328
My brain’s got zero design ideas left.

00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:50.490
Who the heck put me in this major?

00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:51.375
You did.

00:21:52.141 --> 00:21:54.170
You said you wanted to flirt with pretty girls.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.210
Did you forget?

00:21:55.325 --> 00:21:56.697
Flirt, my ass!

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.608
The girls here all act like they’re my mom.

00:22:05.753 --> 00:22:08.671
Sorry, we’re just being motherly!

00:22:11.408 --> 00:22:12.988
I’m sorry, Mommy.

00:22:12.988 --> 00:22:14.497
“Mommy,” my freaking ass.

00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:16.278
Leave me out of it.

00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:17.831
Stop flirting around,

00:22:18.176 --> 00:22:20.071
or your girlfriend’s gonna show up
and slap you again.

00:22:20.186 --> 00:22:20.852
What girlfriend?

00:22:21.228 --> 00:22:21.758
I’m single.

00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:22.366
- What?!
- What?!

00:22:22.557 --> 00:22:23.299
- Single?
- Single?

00:22:24.562 --> 00:22:25.327
That’s right.

00:22:25.997 --> 00:22:26.696
I am.

00:22:27.825 --> 00:22:28.660
Why so surprised?

00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:36.228
Why are you so shocked? I’m just single.

00:22:36.228 --> 00:22:37.225
Of course, I’m shocked.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.767
You had a fight with your girlfriend
and crashed at my place yesterday,

00:22:40.246 --> 00:22:42.550
and today you’re proudly saying
you’re single.

00:22:43.756 --> 00:22:44.849
We broke up this morning.

00:22:45.557 --> 00:22:46.506
Here we go again.

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:49.459
This time, what shit did you do?

00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:50.167
Come on.

00:22:50.454 --> 00:22:53.748
Don’t you guys ever think
I’m the one who got done dirty?

00:22:53.863 --> 00:22:54.761
- No!
- No!

00:22:57.135 --> 00:22:58.766
Fine. I’ll admit it.

00:22:59.015 --> 00:22:59.737
I broke up with her.

00:23:02.053 --> 00:23:02.897
I knew it.

00:23:02.993 --> 00:23:04.294
She was unbearable.

00:23:04.715 --> 00:23:06.844
Always asking me for this,
asking me for that.

00:23:07.227 --> 00:23:08.102
It’s annoying.

00:23:08.293 --> 00:23:10.201
So I ended it. We just weren’t compatible.

00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:11.330
It’s over.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.607
So it’s not like…

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.835
you’ve already got your eye
on someone else, right?

00:23:19.212 --> 00:23:21.580
Well, I kinda…

00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:22.553
started talking to someone.

00:23:22.553 --> 00:23:23.053
Just a little.

00:23:23.283 --> 00:23:24.174
When we were fighting.

00:23:24.366 --> 00:23:27.203
Ouch! I’m sorry! I won’t do it again.

00:23:28.064 --> 00:23:29.324
This is so you.

00:23:29.726 --> 00:23:31.391
Don’t yell at me.

00:23:31.659 --> 00:23:34.665
Your friend here is heartbroken.

00:23:38.054 --> 00:23:40.219
It’s Saturday tomorrow.

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:41.699
Go out of town with me.

00:23:42.618 --> 00:23:44.091
Take me on a break from love, please.

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:45.369
Please, please.

00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:47.419
No. I’ve got plans with my mom.

00:23:47.783 --> 00:23:48.485
Bullshit.

00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:50.279
Mom or who, exactly?

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:51.409
It’s really my mom.

00:23:51.581 --> 00:23:52.589
We’re doing a merit-making for my birthday.

00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.088
It’s your birthday this Saturday?

00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:57.001
Which means it’s J’s birthday too.

00:23:57.422 --> 00:23:57.922
Right?

00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:01.575
Sure.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.274
Hi, hi, guys.

00:24:08.442 --> 00:24:09.665
Mai, I thought you were dead.

00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:10.952
Why didn’t you come to class?

00:24:11.622 --> 00:24:12.606
I wasn’t dead.

00:24:12.683 --> 00:24:14.266
Just not waking up.

00:24:14.457 --> 00:24:16.402
For two days straight?

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:21.477
I’ve set my goal.

00:24:21.975 --> 00:24:22.613
Which is?

00:24:22.613 --> 00:24:25.818
I won’t skip class anymore.
I’m done being a burden to my friends.

00:24:25.818 --> 00:24:28.328
If I fail to do so, then—

00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:31.479
Lucky me, I won’t have to help you
scrape through like in high school.

00:24:32.168 --> 00:24:34.927
And I’m grateful
you didn’t enroll in Fashion like me.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.305
Don’t worry, hons.

00:24:37.305 --> 00:24:38.731
Even though we’re in different faculties,

00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:40.637
I can still be your burden.

00:24:42.188 --> 00:24:43.450
From now on,

00:24:43.546 --> 00:24:46.795
I swear I won’t skip class again.

00:24:47.063 --> 00:24:48.196
Starting tomorrow.

00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:49.186
Tomorrow’s Saturday.

00:24:51.502 --> 00:24:52.230
Damn it.

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:54.014
No more education.
You totally ruined my motivation.

00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:56.375
And he just took off.

00:24:58.615 --> 00:24:59.353
I’m outta here.

00:24:59.353 --> 00:25:00.375
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:25:00.911 --> 00:25:01.720
I’m really going.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.752
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:04.762
I’m seriously leaving.

00:25:04.762 --> 00:25:05.481
- Yes!
- Ye!

00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:08.025
Hey, why aren’t you stopping me?

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:09.496
Are we really friends?

00:25:09.496 --> 00:25:10.155
I’ll see you later, dude.

00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:11.228
Fine, see you.

00:25:11.228 --> 00:25:11.983
Hey, wait.

00:25:11.983 --> 00:25:13.804
Hey, man, come back.

00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:16.000
Don’t be sad.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.067
Long time no see. Come sit with us.

00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:19.609
Come on.

00:25:21.581 --> 00:25:22.465
Sit down.

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:26.649
I feel bad for you.

00:25:26.649 --> 00:25:28.302
Don’t feel bad if you enjoyed it.

00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:30.372
Stop laughing.

00:25:30.372 --> 00:25:31.303
I’m not laughing.

00:25:31.303 --> 00:25:33.249
Mai, are you okay, man?

00:25:33.249 --> 00:25:34.311
I’m sulking.

00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:35.560
Mai.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.293
Still sulking.

00:25:37.193 --> 00:25:37.862
You came running here.

00:25:37.862 --> 00:25:38.954
Was there anything you wanna share?

00:25:39.643 --> 00:25:41.627
Ah! I almost forgot.

00:25:42.086 --> 00:25:44.302
Tar, our senior,
just opened a new racing circuit.

00:25:44.302 --> 00:25:46.944
Wanted to see if you guys
want to give it a test run.

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:47.777
I’m in.

00:25:48.236 --> 00:25:48.925
Great.

00:25:49.384 --> 00:25:51.544
But some kid around here might not.

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:55.074
He’s gotta sing
“Happy Birthday” with his mommy.

00:25:57.888 --> 00:25:59.138
Just tell me the time.

00:25:59.463 --> 00:26:00.316
Same time as usual?

00:26:00.316 --> 00:26:01.164
No problem.

00:26:04.801 --> 00:26:07.298
Good. I’m pretty bored these days.

00:26:08.504 --> 00:26:10.013
Need an errand boy to keep me entertained.

00:26:13.591 --> 00:26:15.274
What excuse are you gonna use
to skip your birthday merit?

00:26:15.772 --> 00:26:16.993
I’ve got a plan, alright.

00:26:17.184 --> 00:26:18.876
Don’t let yourself get hurt again, okay?

00:26:18.876 --> 00:26:19.528
I care about you.

00:26:20.198 --> 00:26:20.866
You do?

00:26:40.146 --> 00:26:40.646
Hey.

00:26:41.536 --> 00:26:42.861
What mischievous thing are you doing now?

00:26:46.922 --> 00:26:48.444
Calm down, ma’am.

00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:51.779
I was driving earlier and heard a weird noise.

00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:53.051
So, I’m just checking it.

00:26:53.051 --> 00:26:54.471
Is that so?

00:26:55.899 --> 00:26:57.720
It needs a tune-up from time to time.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.889
I use it every day, after all.

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:01.863
If I hear you boys are racing again…

00:27:01.974 --> 00:27:03.288
Who’d dare, ma’am?

00:27:03.473 --> 00:27:05.733
And don’t think I don’t know
you got the car remapped.

00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:09.166
Do you really need
that kind of speed in Bangkok, hm?

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:10.860
You know car terms now.

00:27:11.256 --> 00:27:12.447
What a smart lady you are.

00:27:12.447 --> 00:27:13.502
Don’t change the subject.

00:27:13.502 --> 00:27:15.288
All done.

00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:16.700
I’m hungry now.

00:27:17.275 --> 00:27:19.503
Can you make me an omelet, please?

00:27:19.503 --> 00:27:21.875
Jeez, stay away from me!

00:27:22.543 --> 00:27:24.232
I can’t let my mom find out.

00:27:24.733 --> 00:27:28.554
Tell Tar he can’t post
any photos on his Page.

00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:29.295
Okay.

00:27:29.684 --> 00:27:31.810
I’ll tell Mai to double-check with Tar.

00:27:32.886 --> 00:27:35.708
But what excuse are you gonna use
to skip your birthday merit?

00:27:36.969 --> 00:27:38.124
I’ve got a plan, alright.

00:27:38.402 --> 00:27:39.122
What about you?

00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:40.446
Where are you crashing tonight?

00:27:41.256 --> 00:27:42.969
Going home or crashing at Farm’s?

00:27:43.358 --> 00:27:44.108
Crashing at Farm’s.

00:27:44.423 --> 00:27:46.599
He took me to pack up my stuff
at my ex’s.

00:27:49.274 --> 00:27:49.774
Shit.

00:27:49.774 --> 00:27:50.413
I gotta go, Jinn.

00:27:51.007 --> 00:27:51.647
Hey!

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.959
Take it and go to hell.

00:27:56.959 --> 00:27:58.997
Don’t throw it. I’ll come up and get it myself.

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:03.564
Ouch!

00:28:04.028 --> 00:28:04.683
Van!

00:28:06.092 --> 00:28:07.070
Are you okay?

00:28:08.096 --> 00:28:08.754
Damn it.

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:09.979
You always get into this kind of problem.

00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:12.004
I’m hurt again.

00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:19.118
Why so serious?

00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:20.526
It’s not like I’m dying.

00:28:21.527 --> 00:28:22.617
I’m afraid it’ll sting.

00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:24.809
I usually get slapped
and end up with split lips.

00:28:25.328 --> 00:28:26.830
This time it’s just a cut on the head.

00:28:27.182 --> 00:28:28.138
No big deal, my friend.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.179
Don’t let yourself get hurt again, okay?

00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:31.144
I don’t like it.

00:28:31.997 --> 00:28:32.695
What’s wrong?

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:34.158
I care about you.

00:28:37.941 --> 00:28:38.687
You do?

00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:43.328
I care about all of my friends.

00:28:43.402 --> 00:28:45.676
Who in their right mind
would want to see their friend injured?

00:28:45.676 --> 00:28:46.793
Mm.

00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:47.483
Okay.

00:28:48.262 --> 00:28:49.076
Lean over.

00:28:49.614 --> 00:28:50.544
Be gentle, alright?

00:28:50.544 --> 00:28:51.276
Yeah.

00:28:51.387 --> 00:28:52.605
You’re making me scared.

00:28:56.462 --> 00:28:56.962
Ow.

00:28:56.962 --> 00:28:58.431
What? Does it hurt?

00:28:58.431 --> 00:28:59.346
No, I’m just kidding.

00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:00.728
You jerk.

00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:01.977
Ouch.

00:29:01.977 --> 00:29:02.759
Van.

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:03.741
It really hurts this time.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:05.910
Done.

00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:11.771
So, what now?

00:29:12.272 --> 00:29:14.049
You don’t have
your girlfriend’s place to crash anymore.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.087
Well…

00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:20.702
I guess I’ll look for a condo nearby.

00:29:21.444 --> 00:29:22.376
Don’t feel like going home.

00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:23.645
It’s a long drive.

00:29:25.648 --> 00:29:27.081
If you don’t mind…

00:29:28.602 --> 00:29:30.226
you can crash at my place.

00:29:30.653 --> 00:29:32.254
I don’t even know what ‘mind’ means.

00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:34.940
So yeah, I’ll share your room, my friend.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.605
Deal.

00:29:36.551 --> 00:29:37.266
I’m going to bed.

00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:40.102
Jeez, Van.

00:29:40.547 --> 00:29:41.990
You want another cut or what?

00:29:42.658 --> 00:29:43.816
You can take the couch.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.483
Is this my room or yours?

00:30:00.035 --> 00:30:00.720
Shit.

00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:14.681
Is it that bad?

00:30:14.848 --> 00:30:15.994
Bad?

00:30:16.866 --> 00:30:18.234
I didn’t even realize.

00:30:18.364 --> 00:30:20.502
I think I should take you to the hospital.

00:30:20.502 --> 00:30:22.592
It’s okay. I already went.

00:30:23.019 --> 00:30:24.449
What did the doctor say?

00:30:26.256 --> 00:30:27.738
Well…

00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:29.913
I’ve got a fever.

00:30:31.404 --> 00:30:33.711
Some kind of virus, Mom.

00:30:34.453 --> 00:30:35.641
They gave me medicine.

00:30:36.256 --> 00:30:37.839
Don’t worry, Mom.

00:30:39.635 --> 00:30:41.685
But you were perfectly fine the other day.

00:30:41.685 --> 00:30:43.032
I’ll get better soon.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.510
Let’s go to the temple another time.

00:30:48.122 --> 00:30:50.095
I’m sorry I can’t go as planned, Mom.

00:30:50.095 --> 00:30:51.394
That’s alright.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.502
Take care of yourself.

00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:54.608
Get well soon.

00:30:55.943 --> 00:30:57.755
You’re my only child.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.360
Yes, Mom.

00:31:03.894 --> 00:31:05.292
I’m coming for you…

00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:09.084
J!

00:32:14.665 --> 00:32:15.598
What the hell was that?

00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:55.417
There’s no point checking it.

00:32:57.346 --> 00:32:59.274
It all comes down to skill.

00:33:04.485 --> 00:33:05.308
J, you asshole.

00:33:05.493 --> 00:33:07.364
Would it kill you
to leave me in peace for once?

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:10.095
Hm?

00:33:10.892 --> 00:33:13.103
You guys always bring a war with you
whenever you come see me.

00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:16.838
- Tar.
- Tar.

00:33:22.272 --> 00:33:25.181
What an honor to have you two race
the opening run on my track.

00:33:36.256 --> 00:33:37.661
Gosh, you’re already giving me a headache.

00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:39.742
How long have you two
been fighting, anyway?

00:33:39.964 --> 00:33:41.819
Wow, like forever, bro.

00:33:45.695 --> 00:33:49.334
So, what’s the bet this time?

00:33:49.557 --> 00:33:50.448
Will it be fun?

00:33:51.357 --> 00:33:52.183
Can I join?

00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:53.994
Is it ever not fun?

00:33:55.663 --> 00:33:58.350
Tar, will you excuse me?

00:33:58.573 --> 00:34:00.279
When your track’s ready,
just have someone come get me.

00:34:00.483 --> 00:34:01.546
I can’t stand his stinking face.

00:34:05.032 --> 00:34:06.121
Careful when you walk.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.578
Don’t trip.

00:34:09.377 --> 00:34:11.426
Don’t lose your strength
before you hit the accelerator.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.652
Are you two ever going to get along?

00:34:20.877 --> 00:34:21.694
Maybe.

00:34:24.068 --> 00:34:27.570
If Jinn gets on his knees and begs me.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.633
- Ouch.
- Ow.

00:34:36.763 --> 00:34:37.842
You are classmates.

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:39.213
Why do you have to fight every single day?

00:34:39.547 --> 00:34:41.628
I’m so sick of you two.

00:34:51.558 --> 00:34:52.150
Ouch.

00:34:53.226 --> 00:34:55.465
I’ll never be friends with you.

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:00.817
Hi, bro.

00:35:01.256 --> 00:35:02.608
We’re here.

00:35:04.351 --> 00:35:05.954
I thought you two wouldn’t come.

00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:10.501
Whose foot did that to your head?

00:35:10.668 --> 00:35:13.047
Yeah, someone like him always gets that.

00:35:14.197 --> 00:35:18.629
Can’t you go through
one breakup without getting hurt?

00:35:18.629 --> 00:35:19.767
It’s not like I wanted this.

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:21.642
Who’d want to get hurt?

00:35:22.347 --> 00:35:24.278
You bothered Farm
to patch you up again, didn’t you?

00:35:24.723 --> 00:35:26.597
I also gave him one more headache.

00:35:26.857 --> 00:35:29.051
I just moved into his condo.

00:35:30.312 --> 00:35:31.309
What’s going on here?

00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:33.356
You guys are oddly inseparable.

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:37.565
Haven’t we always been inseparable?

00:35:37.695 --> 00:35:38.598
Van!

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.655
Are you about to race?

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.933
I’m getting excited already.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.330
They’re still clearing the track.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.184
Should be done soon.

00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:46.757
Alright. Be good.

00:35:46.757 --> 00:35:49.077
Safety first. Don’t do anything stupid again.

00:35:49.077 --> 00:35:50.093
I know.

00:35:50.835 --> 00:35:51.826
Where’s J anyways?

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.750
Hey, lack of sleep?

00:35:58.046 --> 00:36:00.317
If your health isn’t fit for it,
I’m not letting you race.

00:36:00.855 --> 00:36:01.800
It’s not that, bro.

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.040
I just haven’t had a proper night’s sleep.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:05.550
What’s the matter?

00:36:17.207 --> 00:36:17.989
Tar…

00:36:19.176 --> 00:36:21.258
have you ever dreamed about
the same person over and over?

00:36:24.485 --> 00:36:26.062
Over and over?

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.037
About the same person,

00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:33.611
but in different situations.

00:36:33.954 --> 00:36:35.119
What kind of situations?

00:36:36.899 --> 00:36:38.502
Just ordinary, everyday stuff.

00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:40.890
Sometimes it’s just
a quick flash in my dream,

00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:43.301
sometimes it lasts longer,

00:36:43.709 --> 00:36:47.352
and sometimes it’s just them
going through their daily routine.

00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.986
And who is it you keep dreaming about?

00:37:14.127 --> 00:37:15.356
Your boy’s here.

00:37:15.987 --> 00:37:16.722
Beam.

00:37:18.373 --> 00:37:19.663
Who do you think is gonna win?

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:34.192
J!

00:37:35.809 --> 00:37:36.309
Hey!

00:37:36.732 --> 00:37:37.340
Are you alright?

00:37:38.484 --> 00:37:39.501
I kept calling you.

00:37:40.211 --> 00:37:41.296
Your boy’s here to see you.

00:37:42.082 --> 00:37:42.651
Hi, Beam.

00:37:43.906 --> 00:37:45.748
I thought I wouldn’t make it in time.

00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:47.342
Lucky me, I finished my errands early.

00:37:50.305 --> 00:37:51.414
Can I get a hug?

00:37:51.928 --> 00:37:53.076
You know, for emotional support?

00:37:53.711 --> 00:37:54.293
Of course.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.173
Why would you even
join a race like this against Jinn?

00:38:03.385 --> 00:38:04.949
It’s dangerous. I’m worried.

00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:06.335
Don’t worry, Beam.

00:38:06.637 --> 00:38:08.362
You can pick wherever you want to eat.

00:38:08.362 --> 00:38:10.964
After I win, we’ll celebrate.

00:38:13.484 --> 00:38:15.298
Sure. Be safe, okay?

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.488
Farm, look after him for me.

00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:20.215
Mm.

00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:22.802
You two done snuggling up?

00:38:22.923 --> 00:38:25.498
If not, I’ll go take a nap upstairs while I wait.

00:38:34.916 --> 00:38:36.215
Cone on, dude.

00:38:37.117 --> 00:38:39.156
Farm, let’s go watch from the box upstairs.

00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:40.800
Let’s go.

00:38:41.737 --> 00:38:43.336
Please, please.

00:38:50.779 --> 00:38:51.872
Who do you think’s gonna win?

00:38:52.839 --> 00:38:54.006
Can I choose not to guess?

00:38:54.596 --> 00:38:56.589
I just hope they make it out safe and sound.

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.314
- Sadhu, your holiness.
- Sadhu, your holiness.

00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:02.817
I’m betting on J this time.

00:39:06.399 --> 00:39:07.139
Why?

00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:10.138
He’s got strong support here.

00:39:10.561 --> 00:39:12.869
He can’t lose face, can he?

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.875
I’ll go for Jinn, then.

00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:15.727
Why’s that?

00:39:15.727 --> 00:39:19.499
Maybe the fire in his heart will light up
the engine and make it go faster.

00:39:20.345 --> 00:39:21.728
That’s just the dumbest reason.

00:39:22.514 --> 00:39:23.964
How many laps, Tar?

00:39:24.297 --> 00:39:26.353
Jinn asked for three laps.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.419
Said after that, he’ll send J straight
to the crematorium and let him burn.

00:39:28.484 --> 00:39:29.381
Wow!

00:39:29.638 --> 00:39:32.604
Those two can turn
any sentence into a war of words.

00:39:33.148 --> 00:39:34.794
When will they ever stop competing?

00:40:01.729 --> 00:40:02.429
Damn.

00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:04.129
That’s about the same start speed.

00:40:18.228 --> 00:40:19.553
Hey, look. Jinn’s taking the lead!

00:40:34.453 --> 00:40:35.330
Keep on dreaming.

00:40:41.356 --> 00:40:42.704
I didn’t know their cars were this fast.

00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:44.142
They got their cars modified.

00:40:45.563 --> 00:40:46.220
Damn.

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:48.065
They really don’t care about their lives.

00:40:50.313 --> 00:40:52.287
If I’d known, I never would’ve let them race.

00:40:57.461 --> 00:40:58.065
Damn it!

00:40:58.277 --> 00:41:00.112
Hey, J’s taking the lead now!

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:11.320
J, you bastard.

00:41:40.712 --> 00:41:41.601
What the hell is wrong with him?

00:41:43.218 --> 00:41:44.851
Hey, what’s happening to J?

00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:46.025
J, be safe.

00:41:57.912 --> 00:41:59.032
Shit. What the heck?

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.369
Hey.

00:42:03.484 --> 00:42:04.375
What are you looking at?

00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:11.569
Shit!

00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:12.668
No!

00:42:17.838 --> 00:42:18.484
J!

00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:20.632
J!

00:42:22.174 --> 00:42:23.398
Damn it, J. Can you hear me?

00:42:37.358 --> 00:42:38.011
J!

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.963
Do you hear me? Unlock the car.

00:42:44.308 --> 00:42:46.636
Jackass! Answer me!

00:42:46.636 --> 00:42:47.680
Open your damn eyes.

00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:15.514
You boys must live together.

00:43:15.514 --> 00:43:16.361
Eat together.

00:43:17.313 --> 00:43:18.455
Sleep together.

00:43:19.664 --> 00:43:23.930
Until J is fully recovered.

00:43:24.776 --> 00:43:27.214
At least you guys get to live
and spend time together.

00:43:27.653 --> 00:43:29.806
Who knows — sparks might fly.

00:43:31.061 --> 00:43:32.306
Don’t get too close to me.

00:43:33.197 --> 00:43:34.591
Or you will fall in love.

00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.847
Why is it always you

00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:39.770
in every single dream?
