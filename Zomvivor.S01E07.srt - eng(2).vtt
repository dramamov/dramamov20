00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.865
The weather is hot.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.385
Hello, Aunty.

00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:33.505
Hi.

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:35.465
Hi.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:10.105
Hey! Toom, what's wrong? Are you okay?

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:12.825
Hey!

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:16.825
-Hey, give me a second.
-Wait.

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:18.825
Sir? Sir.

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:28.585
Professor?
There's something wrong with Tisha.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:32.945
Tisha!

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:34.865
Tisha, are you okay?

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:36.585
Tisha!

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:38.745
Mom!

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:41.505
Mom. Oh!

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:58.265
Aunty Jit?

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:02.585
Aunty Jit?
I brought you some snacks.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:08.304
Aunty Jit?

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:09.744
Tisha!

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:11.945
Tisha!

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:17.905
Tisha! Why is there blood on you?

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:29.905
Toom!

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:35.105
Wake up!

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:51.025
What now?

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:46.465
Help me!

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:18.265
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is so scary

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.504
Do I need to be scared?

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:26.945
That you're thinking of leaving me
and about to go

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:31.585
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is real scary

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.185
You asshole.

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:18.665
You remember? You once asked me
to scratch your ex's car with you,

00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:21.545
but he was in the car.

00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:24.625
By the time I realized,
you'd already run away.

00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:30.825
I was like, "What do I do?"

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.265
I was so damn confused.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:36.625
Was that when we were freshmen?

00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:39.665
That time Lily was so into Prao.

00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:43.385
You told me that you want to be
as strong as Prao.

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:46.345
You were so stupid.

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.705
One slap from her,
and you were done with her.

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:54.265
That day I was so drunk

00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:56.545
and lashed out at Prao,

00:06:57.705 --> 00:06:59.825
so she splashed her drink on me.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:03.305
But you came out of nowhere
and slapped her in the face.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.505
Why did you do that?

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:17.585
That's how you always are.

00:07:21.265 --> 00:07:22.985
You help everyone.

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:26.105
You never leave anyone behind.

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:49.905
Tell me.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:56.905
If you say that you want to leave…

00:08:02.785 --> 00:08:04.625
I'll be the one to take you.

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:16.105
Shit!

00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:18.105
Kawin!

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:19.665
Someone is coming.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:22.025
-Did you lock the door?
-I locked it!

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:24.345
Come here!

00:08:40.225 --> 00:08:43.945
PLEASE OPEN AND CLOSE
THE DOORS GENTLY. ONE AT A TIME.

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:47.625
Lily…

00:11:48.825 --> 00:11:50.145
Why did she…

00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:53.145
She helped us.

00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:58.025
We can't stay here anymore. Let's go.

00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:07.065
Damn! Sun.

00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:02.985
Phu will come this way.

00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:10.065
-Hey.
-Damn.

00:13:18.825 --> 00:13:21.425
Hurry! Just leave it!

00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:32.025
We can go now.

00:13:32.105 --> 00:13:33.105
Hey!

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:39.665
Faster!

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:44.225
-Hey.
-Go quickly.

00:13:47.665 --> 00:13:50.345
There's more of them coming.
We don't have much time.

00:13:50.425 --> 00:13:53.465
Once we catch it,
we need to take it to the tenth-floor lab.

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:32.985
They're coming. Get ready.

00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.145
Aunty Jit.

00:16:26.425 --> 00:16:27.665
Aunty!

00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:30.025
Why is your face so pale?

00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:39.585
-Mook, why aren't they here yet?
-Wait.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:40.665
Be quiet.

00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:42.305
Aunty Jit.

00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:46.985
Can you remember me?

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:48.825
Is that Ning?

00:16:50.185 --> 00:16:51.625
Can you remember me?

00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:02.025
When you graduate, don't forget me.

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:06.944
Don't worry about it. I still owe
most of the Patron's scholarship.

00:17:08.105 --> 00:17:09.505
It's me, Ning.

00:17:16.145 --> 00:17:18.385
Hey. What happened?

00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:22.625
Are you okay?

00:17:26.224 --> 00:17:27.545
What should we do, Phu?

00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:29.825
Call it off. We need to help her.

00:17:30.305 --> 00:17:33.185
How? We have no way to escape.

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:37.585
If the other zombies hear their mother,
they will definitely come for us.

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:40.905
No.

00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:43.825
We'll keep doing this.

00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:46.905
Aunty!

00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:50.225
Hey!

00:17:53.465 --> 00:17:54.545
That's Nonn.

00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:56.385
Come here!

00:18:01.945 --> 00:18:03.585
Damn it. Aunty!

00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:08.385
Hey!

00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:12.505
Aunty!

00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:14.905
-Ning!
-Ning!

00:18:14.985 --> 00:18:17.385
Get out! Ning! Get out!

00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:20.265
Ning!

00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:21.505
Y'all, be prepared!

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:25.025
Ning!

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.705
-Ning!
-No!

00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:30.025
-Stop!
-Ning!

00:18:31.705 --> 00:18:32.785
Hurry!

00:18:32.865 --> 00:18:34.345
What are you guys doing?

00:18:36.905 --> 00:18:39.985
Take it inside!

00:18:40.065 --> 00:18:42.745
Go! Get inside!

00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:53.665
-Lock it.
-Nonn, careful.

00:18:54.345 --> 00:18:56.825
-Hurry!
-Hey! Fuck!

00:18:57.225 --> 00:19:00.305
Damn.

00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:17.385
Damn.

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:19.665
Damn.

00:19:20.545 --> 00:19:22.945
-Fuck you!
-San.

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:28.265
-Hey! San!
-Stop it!

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.585
Hey! Why are you hitting him?

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:45.785
We're too late.

00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:21.105
PLEASE EXCHANGE YOUR CARD

00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:14.145
We're all going to die.

00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:21.145
Where are we going now?

00:22:35.785 --> 00:22:37.825
Pao must be feeling sad too, Mook.

00:22:37.905 --> 00:22:40.985
Why? Why did he kill Pao?

00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:43.865
Why did he have to kill Pao?

00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:53.905
Hurry.

00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.505
Why did he have to kill Pao?

00:23:27.905 --> 00:23:28.985
I'm done watching.

00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:34.705
You saw it, right?

00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:39.545
What were you thinking?

00:23:44.105 --> 00:23:45.625
Take Aunty Jit and then what?

00:23:46.945 --> 00:23:49.065
What will you do
after taking her to the lab?

00:23:49.705 --> 00:23:51.025
Ning, listen.

00:23:51.105 --> 00:23:53.785
Aunty Jit is definitely important
to all of them.

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:58.105
They won't come after us for sure
as long as we've got the mother.

00:23:58.185 --> 00:23:59.225
The mother?

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:02.505
You guys are fucking crazy!

00:24:05.505 --> 00:24:07.385
What makes you're so sure, Phu?

00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:09.865
What's wrong with you?

00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:13.025
My little brother is with you, Phu.

00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:15.705
Son of a bitch!
Putting my little brother at risk.

00:24:15.785 --> 00:24:17.145
Are you crazy?

00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:20.345
Are we supposed to do nothing?

00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:25.825
Do we just stay put?

00:24:26.745 --> 00:24:31.345
Wait for your orders, do this, do that.
Like that?

00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:34.385
Now's not the time to argue!

00:24:36.145 --> 00:24:38.985
We need to figure out
how we're getting out of this room.

00:24:39.065 --> 00:24:40.265
Ning.

00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:46.265
What's that?

00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:54.785
-I'll tell you later.
-Say it now.

00:24:57.185 --> 00:24:58.385
What's in there?

00:25:01.985 --> 00:25:03.225
What is it?

00:25:03.305 --> 00:25:05.385
-Give it to me.
-No.

00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:08.065
Give it to me!

00:25:10.945 --> 00:25:11.985
It's evidence.

00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:15.825
What evidence?

00:25:18.585 --> 00:25:19.745
It's a serum.

00:25:21.105 --> 00:25:22.505
What serum?

00:25:25.825 --> 00:25:28.025
Chaiwut Kiatpipat.

00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:30.665
Joe's serum.

00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:36.385
Hmm?

00:25:38.265 --> 00:25:41.745
That means the Patron asked you
and Wiroj to make the serum for his son?

00:25:42.185 --> 00:25:44.545
You already know
about the Anisong project, right?

00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:47.105
How did you find out, San?

00:25:49.225 --> 00:25:50.545
And then what?

00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:53.185
That's it.

00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:55.425
My dad doesn't trust me.

00:25:57.025 --> 00:25:59.105
So he came up with this damn serum.

00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:01.425
San, bring me more.

00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:03.625
Is it really possible?

00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:04.825
Right?

00:26:04.905 --> 00:26:07.665
Dead but not a trace of decay.
How's that possible?

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:09.905
Ever seen my dad fail at something?

00:26:18.505 --> 00:26:22.785
Well, isn't telling us
gonna get you in trouble?

00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:24.545
Yeah.

00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:26.745
Of course.

00:26:31.545 --> 00:26:32.825
Here you go.

00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:43.625
All of my life…

00:26:46.065 --> 00:26:48.065
Since I was born until now…

00:26:50.105 --> 00:26:52.865
I've only been forced to be friends
with you guys.

00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:57.105
Soon, my kids and grandkids
will only be with yours.

00:26:57.185 --> 00:26:58.345
Is that fair?

00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:07.225
The Anisong project,
it's the biggest secret of my family.

00:27:07.345 --> 00:27:09.665
If it leaks, everything will be ruined.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:12.865
What if I told my dad
that you guys knew about this?

00:27:13.785 --> 00:27:14.985
What he's going to do?

00:27:15.065 --> 00:27:17.585
We not going to say anything. Don't worry.

00:27:17.665 --> 00:27:20.105
-Swear to God.
-Hey. No, no.

00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:24.785
Look, I know that none of you
will bring this up.

00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:27.625
If my family is ruined,
yours will be, too.

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.065
I'm just curious.

00:27:30.745 --> 00:27:34.225
What if I tell my dad,
what do you think he will do?

00:27:34.945 --> 00:27:38.225
Let's say I find out

00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:44.425
that some of you here
haven't been loyal to me…

00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:47.625
even after I trusted you.

00:27:57.705 --> 00:27:59.505
Hey! No need to be serious.

00:28:00.105 --> 00:28:02.505
It's just hypothetical, you fool!

00:28:03.905 --> 00:28:07.105
See? San doesn't look stressed.
Let me see your smile.

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:18.545
I said smile!

00:28:21.225 --> 00:28:22.065
Yeah.

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:26.185
See?

00:28:27.545 --> 00:28:29.505
What I ask of you is simple.

00:28:30.305 --> 00:28:31.985
If I call any of you…

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:35.505
you need to be available.

00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:39.665
If I tell you to be somewhere,
you need to be there.

00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:41.305
You can't say no.

00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:43.385
For anything.

00:28:44.545 --> 00:28:45.705
Got it?

00:28:56.505 --> 00:28:58.025
Do you understand?

00:28:58.105 --> 00:28:59.505
-Yeah.
-Got it.

00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:04.425
Fuck yeah! That's it.

00:29:04.505 --> 00:29:06.785
Right? Okay?

00:29:16.425 --> 00:29:19.385
-Joe told us his dad's plan.
-Us? Us who?

00:29:28.425 --> 00:29:30.665
You were in the lab that night,
weren't you?

00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:36.065
Am I right?

00:29:38.505 --> 00:29:39.945
You were there with Joe.

00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:44.145
Wait. What are you talking about?

00:29:45.185 --> 00:29:46.185
Answer me!

00:29:49.345 --> 00:29:51.305
So you really knew about this all along.

00:29:51.385 --> 00:29:55.505
How the hell could you do this?
How could you do something like that?

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:56.865
Ning, don't speak loudly.

00:29:59.225 --> 00:30:01.465
You're the reason Mom ended up like this.

00:30:01.545 --> 00:30:03.665
Like what?

00:30:03.745 --> 00:30:06.865
Say it! Say it so your brother
can hear you.

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:09.385
Go on, tell him about your mother.

00:30:14.665 --> 00:30:17.145
Your mother is not just
a helpless messenger.

00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:19.705
She is a slave who works underground
for the Patron.

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:21.065
Say it out loud!

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:30.145
Ning.

00:30:31.905 --> 00:30:33.465
What is San talking about?

00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:40.665
Mom and Joe have the same disease.

00:30:42.305 --> 00:30:45.465
The Patron ordered Wiroj and me
to develop the cure.

00:30:47.025 --> 00:30:48.425
But everything went wrong.

00:30:51.025 --> 00:30:54.865
All the chaos that's happened,
it's all because of me.

00:30:54.945 --> 00:30:57.785
-No! Ning, it has nothing to do with you.
-You, shut up!

00:30:59.425 --> 00:31:00.705
Wait.

00:31:00.785 --> 00:31:03.825
Does the stuff in this test tube
actually infect people?

00:31:04.945 --> 00:31:06.745
This version is fully developed.

00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:10.105
But there was a previous version…

00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:14.305
that had already been given to volunteers.

00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:16.265
Volunteers?

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:18.185
Who are they?

00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:38.385
You knew everything from the beginning.

00:31:39.505 --> 00:31:42.065
-You wouldn't let us do anything.
-It's not like that.

00:31:42.145 --> 00:31:45.025
-Then what is it?
-She just found out, too!

00:31:45.105 --> 00:31:49.425
Can't you just stop defending her?
We've never mattered to her at all!

00:31:49.505 --> 00:31:53.105
I don't understand. Why does everything
have to depend on you?

00:31:53.905 --> 00:31:56.225
Why do you have to be
the center of everything?

00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:59.025
I was wondering,
is it because you have a tough life

00:31:59.105 --> 00:32:01.585
or is it because
you people are fucking liars?

00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:05.145
-Mook!
-What? Are you going to kill me?

00:32:06.945 --> 00:32:09.185
Fight back like you did for him.

00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:15.985
But how can you people even live
with yourselves? I'm so curious.

00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:19.065
Your mom's a liar. You're a liar!

00:32:19.785 --> 00:32:21.305
And so is your brother.

00:32:21.385 --> 00:32:23.385
I'm serious, you really didn't know?

00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:27.625
That they're having an affair
behind your back?

00:32:52.425 --> 00:32:54.025
You really believe that?

00:32:57.185 --> 00:33:00.585
Are you serious right now?
Like, right now?

00:33:05.225 --> 00:33:08.905
Let them talk right now.
There's no need to wait any longer.

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:15.545
I let someone die.

00:33:25.585 --> 00:33:27.825
She's a scientist
in the Patron's laboratory.

00:33:32.985 --> 00:33:35.545
Joe was ordered to keep quiet,
and so were we.

00:33:37.425 --> 00:33:38.745
I can't tell anyone.

00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:43.225
Can't say to anyone that…

00:33:48.825 --> 00:33:50.145
That…

00:33:51.585 --> 00:33:52.985
I need help.

00:33:55.105 --> 00:33:56.305
Please help me.

00:33:57.985 --> 00:33:59.865
I have something to show you guys.

00:34:03.865 --> 00:34:04.985
Here.

00:34:07.025 --> 00:34:09.264
I hacked the cameras in my dad's lab.

00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:13.185
Damn! Who's that? She looks good.

00:34:13.264 --> 00:34:14.545
Serum maker.

00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:17.425
-Do you want to know her?
-Hell, yeah.

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:21.865
Hey, everyone.
I booked a table at the club.

00:34:22.425 --> 00:34:25.185
-They confirmed it.
-We'll go somewhere else.

00:34:25.264 --> 00:34:27.304
-But, Joe--
-We'll go somewhere else.

00:34:28.784 --> 00:34:29.824
San.

00:34:30.744 --> 00:34:32.304
What you need to say is "yes".

00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:34.344
Let's go. Right now.

00:34:35.264 --> 00:34:38.185
Yeah! Let's go!

00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:39.465
San, you're the driver.

00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:41.505
-Go.
-Let's go!

00:34:48.225 --> 00:34:49.385
It's like…

00:34:52.105 --> 00:34:54.385
Like a woman's corpse is inside me.

00:34:58.225 --> 00:35:00.145
I can't get her out of my head.

00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:05.825
San!

00:35:09.265 --> 00:35:10.465
I can't do anything.

00:35:23.225 --> 00:35:24.425
Only Nonn…

00:35:25.545 --> 00:35:27.225
could smell the corpse.

00:35:29.025 --> 00:35:31.105
He actually didn't know what it was.

00:35:34.025 --> 00:35:36.345
But he knew something rotten
was inside me.

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:41.065
But he's still there.

00:35:44.865 --> 00:35:47.145
Nothing happened between Nonn and me.

00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:51.425
He was the one who noticed
something was wrong with me.

00:35:59.185 --> 00:36:01.145
I would never do something like that.

00:36:02.105 --> 00:36:04.105
The way you and your mom did.

00:36:15.905 --> 00:36:18.825
Tell us everything.
What the hell have you done?

00:36:56.185 --> 00:36:57.185
Gus…

00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:18.545
Could you please forgive me?

00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:27.945
Let go of me!

00:37:28.025 --> 00:37:30.185
I'm so sorry!

00:37:30.305 --> 00:37:32.065
Earth!

00:37:32.225 --> 00:37:34.465
I'm sorry!

00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:37.065
I said I'm sorry!

00:37:37.145 --> 00:37:41.065
-Gus! Gus!
-What are you going to do, Game?

00:37:41.145 --> 00:37:42.745
-No, Patra!
-No!

00:37:42.825 --> 00:37:45.185
-No, Patra!
-Back off!

00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:51.705
Let go of me! That's my brother!

00:37:52.865 --> 00:37:55.105
Enough, Game.
That's not your brother anymore.

00:38:00.865 --> 00:38:01.945
Gus…

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.705
Who did this to my brother?

00:38:18.625 --> 00:38:19.945
Earth…

00:38:20.585 --> 00:38:22.785
Did you meet any science kids?

00:38:28.305 --> 00:38:29.745
You met them, right?

00:38:29.825 --> 00:38:32.065
Was it Ning, Jean and Pao?

00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:38.625
Myxozoa.

00:38:39.185 --> 00:38:40.305
Yeah.

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:46.625
It mutated from nuclear waste,
attached to jellyfish,

00:38:46.705 --> 00:38:48.145
and is causing this behavior.

00:38:49.225 --> 00:38:52.305
They form groups to hunt
and even eat their own kind.

00:38:52.385 --> 00:38:53.825
They're like those zombies.

00:38:53.905 --> 00:38:55.505
But there's more than that.

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:58.705
Last night, Aek and I saw them fight.

00:38:58.785 --> 00:39:01.385
Huh? Why did they fight?

00:39:02.505 --> 00:39:03.585
I have no idea.

00:39:04.785 --> 00:39:07.545
But at that time,
I was surrounded by a group of zombies.

00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:10.025
Then another group
came rushing from behind.

00:39:10.665 --> 00:39:12.145
If I had to guess,

00:39:12.265 --> 00:39:15.745
they're fighting over food or territory.

00:39:15.865 --> 00:39:17.225
You are right.

00:39:18.145 --> 00:39:19.185
What is it, Mook?

00:39:20.385 --> 00:39:22.505
Aunty Jit received the serum first.

00:39:24.385 --> 00:39:25.465
And so?

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.945
So we were right.

00:39:30.745 --> 00:39:32.505
Aunty Jit is their pack leader.

00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:35.145
She was the first
to spread the infection to others.

00:39:35.225 --> 00:39:40.345
Every single zombie obeys Aunty Jit
because they see her as their mother.

00:39:40.425 --> 00:39:42.065
Did you all see?

00:39:42.145 --> 00:39:45.545
Aunty Jit is no different from the others.

00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:48.385
She doesn't have the strength to fight us.

00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:52.705
So the reason she became a pack leader
is because she is the oldest?

00:39:53.345 --> 00:39:56.385
Damn it. Isn't that sort of funny?

00:39:57.345 --> 00:40:00.705
It's not funny. This is the realest thing.

00:40:14.785 --> 00:40:17.305
Dr. Kanchana's condition
is still stable, sir.

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:20.665
And as for the metabolic rate
of her cells,

00:40:20.745 --> 00:40:23.945
it's starting to go up, almost matching
the experimental group now.

00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:27.225
What about the cellular respiration rate
and the CPC?

00:40:27.305 --> 00:40:29.105
Everything's normal now.

00:40:30.425 --> 00:40:32.145
Great job, Professor.

00:40:41.745 --> 00:40:42.865
This is not it.

00:40:53.545 --> 00:40:54.625
What's wrong?

00:41:03.025 --> 00:41:07.185
What happened at the university
was caused by that serum.

00:41:08.625 --> 00:41:09.465
Wait, what?

00:41:10.625 --> 00:41:12.025
There must be something else.

00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:14.225
So, basically,
everything you've been saying

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:19.465
means that what's infecting people
is the parasite that live in jellyfish,

00:41:19.545 --> 00:41:21.025
and not the jellyfish?

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:23.065
Yeah.

00:41:23.145 --> 00:41:26.745
But Wiroj went ahead and used
the parasite-infected jellyfish

00:41:26.825 --> 00:41:27.905
to make the serum.

00:41:28.465 --> 00:41:32.105
I tested it on people.
I injected it into Dr. Kanchana.

00:41:32.185 --> 00:41:34.985
I've already injected this serum
into Dr. Kanchana, sir.

00:41:35.385 --> 00:41:36.425
Calm down.

00:41:37.665 --> 00:41:38.865
Take it easy.

00:41:39.505 --> 00:41:41.185
Does anyone know about this?

00:41:43.985 --> 00:41:45.105
No.

00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:48.945
That's it.

00:41:50.065 --> 00:41:51.745
Then you're safe now.

00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:53.785
Get some rest.

00:41:54.505 --> 00:41:56.945
Can you start making the serum for Joe?

00:42:00.425 --> 00:42:02.145
Ning and Nonn are trapped in there.

00:42:02.265 --> 00:42:03.585
Wiroj.

00:42:04.145 --> 00:42:07.705
-No one is going to make it.
-No! Send them in now.

00:42:08.865 --> 00:42:11.305
-You have to accept it.
-Send them in now!

00:42:13.785 --> 00:42:16.105
What do you hope to gain by doing that?

00:42:17.505 --> 00:42:19.065
Joe's serum is this in the lab.

00:42:20.345 --> 00:42:22.065
If you want it, then go get it.

00:42:22.145 --> 00:42:25.265
I'm done working for you!
If you're going to kill me, then do it!

00:42:25.745 --> 00:42:28.945
These documents are the information.

00:42:29.025 --> 00:42:31.825
If it reaches someone trying to fix this,

00:42:32.385 --> 00:42:34.785
it might help clean up this whole mess.

00:42:35.425 --> 00:42:37.065
If I'm gonna be honest,

00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:40.625
that thing could be worth
more than all our lives.

00:42:52.185 --> 00:42:53.385
Wiroj.

00:42:56.385 --> 00:42:57.505
Only the two of them.

00:43:00.305 --> 00:43:01.585
No one else.

00:43:19.425 --> 00:43:22.345
-Hey!
-Stay silent. Quiet.

00:43:23.105 --> 00:43:24.265
Quiet.

00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:52.825
The janitor, she is about
to get in this room.

00:43:54.185 --> 00:43:56.185
She shouldn't know that we're in here.

00:43:58.745 --> 00:44:01.945
What if it keeps pushing?
The door can't hold for long.

00:44:02.025 --> 00:44:03.385
Should we just let her in?

00:44:03.465 --> 00:44:05.625
-Stick to the original plan?
-No, Thorn.

00:44:05.705 --> 00:44:09.425
-There are other zombies. Forget it.
-What should we do?

00:44:09.505 --> 00:44:10.825
What do we do?

00:44:13.345 --> 00:44:17.265
Think! You have to figure it out.
We chose you as a leader.

00:44:17.345 --> 00:44:18.585
I'm thinking.

00:44:23.345 --> 00:44:25.505
What if it comes across
its mother's corpse?

00:44:25.585 --> 00:44:26.785
Myxozoa.

00:44:26.905 --> 00:44:29.185
It's a parasite that live in jellyfish.

00:44:29.265 --> 00:44:30.505
Temperature matters.

00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:33.025
Why are they staying
at the spot that's lit?

00:44:33.105 --> 00:44:35.905
-Aunty Jit is the pack leader.
-They also have feelings.

00:44:35.985 --> 00:44:37.585
Is it because she's the oldest?

00:44:37.665 --> 00:44:40.225
They were the first
to spread the infection.

00:44:43.185 --> 00:44:45.825
No. No. No.

00:44:45.905 --> 00:44:47.545
-What is it? Say it.
-No way.

00:44:47.625 --> 00:44:49.465
-Say it
-We can't do that.

00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:53.065
-No way.
-What is it? Say!

00:44:54.065 --> 00:44:55.105
Tell me!

00:44:55.185 --> 00:44:57.665
We don't have their leader as a hostage.

00:44:58.385 --> 00:45:03.305
But if we have a zombie
infected directly by the leader…

00:45:04.985 --> 00:45:06.105
What?

00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:09.025
We stuck in here.
How will we find that zombie?

00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:11.105
That's why I said we can't do it!

00:45:11.185 --> 00:45:12.305
No.

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:16.785
You know it's possible.

00:45:18.985 --> 00:45:21.065
If anyone here gets infected
with her blood.

00:45:30.345 --> 00:45:31.825
Damn.

00:45:41.985 --> 00:45:43.305
Hey.

00:45:43.385 --> 00:45:46.625
The temperature is higher.
They will go crazy soon.

00:46:03.905 --> 00:46:05.585
I hope you're right, Mook.

00:46:07.785 --> 00:46:09.025
Stop it!

00:46:10.185 --> 00:46:11.305
What are you doing?

00:46:12.065 --> 00:46:14.025
-Leave her.
-No.

00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:16.305
Aren't these documents important?

00:46:16.385 --> 00:46:18.505
Can't they help people?

00:46:19.065 --> 00:46:21.545
If nobody agrees to do it,
we'll all fucking die.

00:46:24.305 --> 00:46:27.825
How do you know it will work?
This is clearly a witch hunt.

00:46:27.905 --> 00:46:29.185
Jean.

00:46:30.745 --> 00:46:32.145
No one is forcing me.

00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:34.425
This is my choice.

00:46:52.265 --> 00:46:54.545
Ning, no.

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.185
Don't do this.

00:46:57.345 --> 00:47:01.425
Nonn, no matter what happens, don't die.

00:47:01.505 --> 00:47:03.465
You're doing this to me again.

00:47:03.545 --> 00:47:05.665
You and Mom always shield me from trouble.

00:47:06.625 --> 00:47:09.905
Am I stupid? Can I do nothing to help?

00:47:09.985 --> 00:47:11.985
There are other ways to do this.

00:47:16.465 --> 00:47:18.385
From now on, everything's on you.

00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:26.905
Everything you need to know is in here.

00:47:27.665 --> 00:47:28.905
Everything.

00:47:30.305 --> 00:47:31.145
Ning!

00:47:33.625 --> 00:47:36.745
Please tell Mom that everything she's done

00:47:36.825 --> 00:47:39.585
hasn't made anyone's life better.

00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:42.545
Ning!

00:48:05.025 --> 00:48:06.585
Please take care of Nonn.

00:48:49.145 --> 00:48:50.465
Jean.

00:48:52.705 --> 00:48:54.665
Put the gun away from my brother.

00:48:57.545 --> 00:48:58.905
If you decide to die…

00:49:01.865 --> 00:49:03.665
then let's die together, all of us.

00:49:09.265 --> 00:49:10.905
-Jean…
-You want to die.

00:49:12.225 --> 00:49:14.945
You want to run away
from problems just like your mom.

00:49:15.025 --> 00:49:17.025
You don't even care if it'll work.

00:49:26.825 --> 00:49:28.625
What are you guys doing?

00:49:29.305 --> 00:49:30.545
Are you guys aware?

00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:33.025
We're just prey for that bastard.

00:49:33.465 --> 00:49:36.905
We're just worthless beings,
trapped in the trash that they created!

00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:40.585
And now…

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:44.705
we're sending our friend to die.

00:49:46.025 --> 00:49:47.905
All just to clean up this mess.

00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:51.665
Why?

00:49:52.145 --> 00:49:55.305
Why do we have to fix the problems
that we didn't even create?

00:50:01.625 --> 00:50:03.145
I won't let it end like this.

00:50:03.225 --> 00:50:04.385
No.

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:09.865
I know you won't do it.

00:50:10.785 --> 00:50:11.865
Ning!

00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:51.585
Shit!

00:50:51.665 --> 00:50:53.665
Run! Hurry!

00:50:54.945 --> 00:50:57.305
-Hurry up!
-Damn it! This way!

00:50:57.385 --> 00:50:58.985
Run!

00:50:59.865 --> 00:51:01.065
-Thorn!
-Go!

00:51:03.945 --> 00:51:05.025
Go, now!

00:51:05.385 --> 00:51:06.745
Quick!

00:51:17.265 --> 00:51:18.425
Shit!

00:51:18.505 --> 00:51:19.545
Hey!

00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:28.825
Get in! Go!

00:51:48.025 --> 00:51:50.505
Faster! Faster!

00:52:01.945 --> 00:52:03.225
We're almost there.

00:52:06.345 --> 00:52:07.385
Copy that.

00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:37.065
Push!

00:52:45.065 --> 00:52:47.345
Shit! Helicopter!

00:52:50.705 --> 00:52:52.025
Enemy on the rooftop.

00:52:52.105 --> 00:52:54.145
-Request to abort mission.
-Wait!

00:52:54.825 --> 00:52:55.945
No!

00:52:57.865 --> 00:52:58.825
Push!

00:52:58.905 --> 00:53:00.665
-Push it!
-Keep pushing!

00:53:03.465 --> 00:53:08.185
Hey! We're here! Hey! We're here!

00:53:10.545 --> 00:53:13.105
The serum is with her. Get closer to her.

00:53:15.265 --> 00:53:17.625
-Help!
-Help!

00:53:18.265 --> 00:53:19.625
Help!

00:53:19.705 --> 00:53:22.465
-Help!
-Over here!

00:53:33.745 --> 00:53:35.065
Guys, come on!

00:53:39.985 --> 00:53:42.625
Hey! Bring all my friends!

00:53:42.705 --> 00:53:44.305
-Ning, No!
-Why?

00:53:44.385 --> 00:53:45.225
No, Ning!

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:56.665
Thorn!

00:53:59.505 --> 00:54:00.665
Thorn!

00:54:00.745 --> 00:54:01.985
Son of a bitch!

00:54:02.065 --> 00:54:04.025
Thorn! Let me go!

00:54:04.105 --> 00:54:06.345
Let go of me! Thorn!

00:54:10.385 --> 00:54:11.545
Push their hands back!

00:54:13.465 --> 00:54:14.345
Hurry!

00:54:25.425 --> 00:54:27.305
Let me go!

00:54:27.385 --> 00:54:30.065
Thi! Thi!

00:54:33.145 --> 00:54:36.145
You bastard! Son of a bitch!
I wish all of you go to hell!

00:54:36.225 --> 00:54:39.745
-I wish your helicopter crashes! Damn!
-Nonn!

00:54:41.425 --> 00:54:43.145
Nonn! Get in the helicopter.

00:54:43.225 --> 00:54:44.105
Go!

00:54:44.665 --> 00:54:45.825
I'm not leaving!

00:54:47.385 --> 00:54:49.145
I said go!

00:54:50.185 --> 00:54:51.265
Go!

00:54:52.065 --> 00:54:52.945
Go now!

00:54:54.905 --> 00:54:57.105
What are you doing? Get in here now!

00:55:04.185 --> 00:55:05.505
We can't wait any longer.

00:55:06.665 --> 00:55:08.505
Nonn, come on!

00:55:08.585 --> 00:55:10.545
-Come now!
-Nonn!

00:55:15.385 --> 00:55:16.385
Go!

00:55:17.705 --> 00:55:19.305
We can't hold on!

00:55:23.985 --> 00:55:25.025
Nonn!

00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:27.545
Nonn! Get in here!

00:55:29.385 --> 00:55:30.665
Go!

00:55:39.945 --> 00:55:41.545
Nonn! Hurry!

00:55:41.625 --> 00:55:42.665
Nonn!

00:55:47.425 --> 00:55:48.585
Nonn!

00:56:06.425 --> 00:56:07.745
I love you.

00:56:09.665 --> 00:56:11.785
I'm sorry for being a terrible sister.

00:56:12.665 --> 00:56:14.425
The one who never believed in you.

00:56:18.945 --> 00:56:20.265
No!

00:56:28.505 --> 00:56:30.585
But I want you to believe
in yourself more.

00:56:39.665 --> 00:56:42.865
Don't let anyone tell you
what you can't do.

00:57:05.105 --> 00:57:07.825
Nonn!

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.905
Nonn!

00:57:10.985 --> 00:57:12.825
Nonn!

00:57:12.905 --> 00:57:15.345
Nonn! Nonn!

00:57:17.185 --> 00:57:18.385
Nonn!

00:57:23.905 --> 00:57:25.745
-Nonn!
-Go!

00:57:25.825 --> 00:57:28.385
Nonn! Nonn!

00:57:32.425 --> 00:57:35.345
Nonn! Nonn!

00:57:35.425 --> 00:57:37.385
Nonn!

00:57:37.465 --> 00:57:39.225
Nonn!

00:57:39.305 --> 00:57:41.105
-Leave now!
-Copy that!

00:57:41.185 --> 00:57:42.665
Fall back, fall back.

00:57:42.785 --> 00:57:47.265
-Let's move.
-Nonn! Nonn! Nonn!

00:57:48.305 --> 00:57:50.705
-Move! Move! Move!
-Nonn!

00:57:50.785 --> 00:57:52.265
Nonn!

00:57:52.345 --> 00:57:54.425
Nonn! Nonn!

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:57.985
Nonn! Nonn!

00:57:59.025 --> 00:58:00.065
Nonn! Nonn!

00:58:02.505 --> 00:58:03.865
Nonn!

00:58:04.865 --> 00:58:05.985
Nonn!

00:58:12.025 --> 00:58:13.585
Nonn!

00:58:53.145 --> 00:58:55.665
Hey! Damn!

00:59:13.145 --> 00:59:14.185
Damn it!

00:59:31.145 --> 00:59:37.065
ONE MONTH LATER

00:59:38.425 --> 00:59:41.505
Joe's body is getting better, sir.

00:59:41.585 --> 00:59:44.625
No complications observed.
The blood test is normal.

00:59:44.705 --> 00:59:48.345
I expect that his body
should return to normal within a week.

00:59:48.425 --> 00:59:49.785
Good.

00:59:50.505 --> 00:59:52.945
As for Dr. Kanchana,

00:59:53.585 --> 00:59:56.025
her body's back to normal now.

00:59:56.105 --> 00:59:57.785
All that's left is to wake her up.

00:59:59.305 --> 01:00:00.945
Do you want us to wake her up now?

01:00:01.745 --> 01:00:04.505
Not yet. Let her sleep.

01:00:05.425 --> 01:00:10.025
Wait for the Venerable to arrive,
so they can stay together as family.

01:00:20.345 --> 01:00:21.465
What happened?

01:00:21.545 --> 01:00:23.345
Ning and Wiroj are gone.

01:00:24.785 --> 01:00:26.025
Let's go!
