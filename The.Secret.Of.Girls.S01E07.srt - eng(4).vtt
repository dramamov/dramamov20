"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 7)

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.460
Why are you in my room?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.980
When did you come in?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.939
What happened?

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.460
Who allowed you to sleep with me?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.900
Say something.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.580
Xu Jingxi.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.700
If you drink again.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.180
I will kill you with
my own two hands.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.540
Twenty-four copies.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Okay, no problem

00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:09.940
24+ copies.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.580
Okay.

00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:16.307
Okay, no problem.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.519
Good morning.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.700
So...

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.380
did you take care of me
when I drank too much last night?

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.940
I'm sorry

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.900
I was a little confused in the morning

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:37.060
I couldn't remember anything.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.140
Your neck is stiff?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.540
What are you going to do?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.300
So...

00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:01.659
Did I snore while sleeping yesterday?

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.940
Grinding my teeth, talking
in my sleep, farting, etc?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.460
Do you not know?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.860
I don't know.

00:06:07.861 --> 00:06:09.140
I used to sleep alone.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.340
Well you did.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.220
Which one?

00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:14.140
Talking in your sleep,
snoring, farting, etc.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.900
All of them?

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.020
Really?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.460
What do you think?

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.460
First of all,
I think she is lying to you

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.500
I think so too.

00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:32.100
Secondly, which one of you can
tell me what happened last night?

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.420
Finally

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.579
I don't mind you guys slacking off.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.300
But do you even see me as your boss?

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.620
I'm literally right here!

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.179
Sis Yun, don't be angry.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.899
It's just that, last
night I drank too much.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.179
Then when I got up, I found Wen Shan was
sleeping in my room, lying on my bed.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.660
So I...

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.899
I didn't sleep

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.380
I was sitting the whole time.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.180
I saw you sleeping

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.740
I slept...?!

00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:01.739
Didn't you see I was sitting?

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.139
I saw you sleeping while sitting

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.580
I was sitting all night

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.740
I don't know.

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:06.899
Anyway, I heard the alarm go off.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.579
Anyway, the alarm didn't wake you up.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.300
You just kept sleeping.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.900
I just didn't sleep.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.420
You slept.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.220
Didn't sleep.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.900
Slept.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.100
Keep going.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100
Pretend I don't exist.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.516
The water spilled, wipe it up

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.540
I'll drink this bit first.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.060
I remember that I made a reservation.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.260
But I just can't find the order content.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.220
Could you please help me check it again?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.499
I'm sorry.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.780
We really can't find your
reservation information.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.459
If your mobile number and name are correct,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.356
we checked the information
and there's no reservation made.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.779
Then can we book a room now?

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.460
All the inns nearby are fully booked.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.459
Xiaoyu, can you check
if there are any extra rooms in our inn?

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.660
I did check, we're fully booked.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.740
I'm really sorry.

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:54.036
Because today is the peak period of the
weekend, so all of our guest rooms are full.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.780
What should we do?

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.460
I'm really sorry.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.500
Maybe you can go
somewhere else to find a place.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.740
But I clearly made a successful reservation.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.940
What's wrong?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.899
They didn't make a reservation.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.580
Our rooms are fully booked.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.979
How about this?

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.900
We'll give you a discount
next time you come.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.780
So where are we staying now?

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.300
I'm really sorry

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.539
I'm sorry for both of you.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.740
We really don't have any rooms today

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.819
I just asked the nearby inns for you.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.980
They're all fully booked.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.500
Why don't you ask the nearby hotels?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.900
We've looked, but...

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.539
the hotels that have
rooms are too expensive.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.820
We're just students.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.100
This really is...

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.620
I understand.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.980
But we really don't
have any other solutions.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.740
What should we do?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.860
We can't sleep on the street.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.980
It's okay

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.819
I just remember that I had booked it.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.820
It's okay.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.020
Let's look somewhere else.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.420
Wait.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.180
If you don't mind, there's a
staff room for you to stay in.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.580
Is that really okay?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.020
As long as we don't have
to sleep on the street, it's fine.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.460
But it's a bit small.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.460
It's okay.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.820
Thank you.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.780
We'll pay the regular room fee.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:09.740
OK

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.979
Xiaoyu, then you help them
register their information

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.716
I'll go and clean up the
room and make some space.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.740
Okay, go ahead.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.700
Please let me see your ID card.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.540
Take a look at the camera.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.340
You're back.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380
What's wrong?

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.700
Are you moving?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.980
Do you need to ask?

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.739
Some people are too kind-hearted.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.020
Offering your own room means you
must pay the price of being too kind.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.820
What price?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.020
They had nowhere to sleep, they
were going to sleep on the street.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.700
You're better than them.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.820
Sleep in the yard.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.259
I know you are not that merciless

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.499
I just saw it.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.780
You secretly asked other inns
if they had any vacant rooms.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.300
You, the sharp tongue
hides a marshmallow heart

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.180
I know.

00:10:22.181 --> 00:10:23.419
You've sheltered me once already.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.979
Now I'm sheltering them.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.419
This carries your spirit forward.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.100
Besides, you slept in my room for a night.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.859
Let me sleep in your room for one night.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.420
Reciprocity is also very reasonable.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.420
What reciprocity?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.340
Get out of the way.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.940
Good night, kind heart.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.220
You will catch a cold
if you sleep in the yard.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.700
You always don't mean what you're saying.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.180
I'm coming in.

00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:24.075
Your room is quite cozy.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.460
It's not like you at all.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.156
Why are you getting special treatment
behind my back?

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.180
You should give me some.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.476
Fortunately, the bed is big enough.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.620
Which side should I sleep on.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.700
Who told you to sleep in the bed?

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.580
Sleep on the floor.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.659
Xiaoyu told me a very funny thing today.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.700
Do you want to hear it?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.580
Turn off the lights.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.580
This is you when you were a child?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.139
You were cute when you were a child.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.340
Why do you look like that now?

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.700
Good night.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.180
Sourpuss.
