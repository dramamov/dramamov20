"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 5)

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.900
Hope I'm not interrupting you two.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.900
Sis Yun.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.340
Then I'll go back to work now.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.180
Perfect timing - let's
see if the food is ready.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.939
Xiao Xu.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.420
You can cook!

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.140
I just know some basic stir-fries.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.180
That's great.

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.540
Finally I don't have to eat noodles
made by Wen Shan today.

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:57.436
Actually, when Wen Shan makes
noodles she also has to make garnishes.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.660
The principles are similar.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.060
You don't understand.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.859
Wen Shan cooks based on her mood.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.740
There's zero precision in how salty it is.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.180
So cooking noodles are the easiest.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.940
If it's too salty, add noodles.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.180
If it's too bland, add gravy

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.020
I'm not picky

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.020
I will eat whatever.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.140
Well.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.620
That's wonderful.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.741
Alright, go ahead and do it.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.380
Okay, right away.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.580
Meal's ready.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.780
You must be starving by now.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.660
It's okay.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.580
You made four dishes all at once.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.299
That's amazing.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300
Just a moment.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.060
Thank you.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.740
Try it and see if it suits your taste.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.860
Sister Yun, chopsticks.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Try this.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.020
How is it?

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.700
Xiao Xu, your cooking is so delicious.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.740
Wen Shan, watch and learn.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.700
Watch and learn.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.700
By the way.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.019
Has your new ID card arrived?

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.740
How long will it take?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.860
I went there yesterday.

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.379
He said that because I couldn't provide
any ID information,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.940
it would take about a week to verify.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.340
How long do you plan to work here?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.300
Are you going to kick me out, Sis Yun?

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:18.339
No, I don't.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.940
No.

00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.380
She's afraid that if you leave,
no one will cook for her.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.980
I'm not that uncouth.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.140
Oh sure.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.100
OK

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.859
Sis Yun, as long as you don't kick me out

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.219
I can keep working here.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.860
Really?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.660
You said it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.020
I'm totally holding you to that.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.100
You don't have to go back to work.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.780
Your parents can't let
you stay here forever.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.580
It's okay.

00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:38.740
They don't care about me.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.900
Let's eat.

00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:45.260
Try the meat.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.940
Try the meat.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.460
Not too bad.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.940
It's delicious.

00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:53.156
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.340
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.420
I can't eat scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.500
Eggplant then.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.540
The ID information has been registered.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.740
The room has been cleaned.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.700
Welcome to check in.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.980
Thank you.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.540
The room...

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.100
I'll take you there.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.060
It's ok, just stay here.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.940
Can you carry it?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.940
Sure.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.660
Thank you.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.900
It's okay.

00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:05.051
What are you doing?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.260
Why didn't you tell me? I was gonna
spend the whole day watering them.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.340
They are waterlogged.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.580
Jingxi.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.660
Do you know the one on the third floor?

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980
What?

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.180
Like I'd dare say anything.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.756
Xiaoyu, I'm leaving, take care of the inn.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.260
Okay.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.740
Sis Wen Shan.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.740
Don't worry.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.099
You go out every night.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.100
Where are you going?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.860
Do I need to report to you?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.500
No.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.860
Focus on your work.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.860
Xiaoyu.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.660
Where does she go every night.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.820
It's a secret.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:19.780
Sis Yun.

00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:20.900
You're here so early today

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.020
I haven't made lunch yet.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.260
Yesterday waw payday

00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:24.299
I got cash for you.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.300
Take it.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.540
Thank you, Sis Yun.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.340
So much!

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.100
I've only been working for a few days.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.036
Don't go saying us
capitalists have no heart now.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.459
You've worked so hard

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.460
I paid you 150 per day.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.180
Count it.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:41.980
No need to count.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.980
Thank you, Sis Yun.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.379
It's a workday - not many customers today.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.020
Take a day off and go out for a walk.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.660
After all, you're here for traveling.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.740
But...

00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:51.380
Wen Shan is also taking a day off today.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.939
If I go out too, will the
inn be understaffed?

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.340
I'm here, right?

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.340
Okay, just go out.

00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:57.379
Or I will regret it.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.380
Thank you, Sis Yun.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.580
By the way.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.180
Haven't you bought a mobile phone yet?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.499
There's a camera here that you can use.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.500
Go get it yourself later.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.780
Thank you, Sis Yun.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.780
Go.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.180
Sis Yun.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.460
You're so nice.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.740
Okay, just go.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.660
It's great to be young.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.380
Don't move.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.060
No. 13 ordered another drink.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.300
OK

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Welcome, how many people?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.020
One.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.380
Where do you want to sit?

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.580
I'll sit there.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:03.980
Thank you.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.980
OK

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.180
Hello, what would you like to drink?

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.140
Do you have any non-alcoholic drinks?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.659
Coke or lemonade?

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.300
Lemonade is fine.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:18.620
Thank you.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.940
Do you want some ice?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.180
Sure.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.020
Wen Shan sings very well.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.980
Thank you.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.460
Do you know her?

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.300
She and I both work at the Time Inn.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.540
You are Xu Jingxi.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.820
You know me.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.579
I heard that you cook very well.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.620
You are also very capable.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.220
Did she say that?

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.220
No.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.100
It's your boss.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.340
You know Sis Yun.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.220
She and I are classmates.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.140
What a coincidence.

00:12:27.778 --> 00:12:28.700
Long Island Iced Tea.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.700
Let me treat you.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.020
Really?

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.340
Thank you.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.660
You aren't allowed to drink.
