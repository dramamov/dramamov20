WEBVTT

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
(This drama is based on a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention to offend any careers, )

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values, )

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
(Presents)

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.360
(Theory of Love)

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.000
You still haven’t come home.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.640
I can’t let you have all the fun.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.640
You’re keeping a secret from me, aren’t you?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.080
Tell me!

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920
Pat.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.040
Let's break up.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.040
Once your car’s fixed,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.120
I’ll have the mechanic drop it off at your office.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.720
Okay.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840
You can get there on your own?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.360
Yes, I’ll just take a taxi.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200
Pat.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.960
I'll get going.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.800
It’s strange, Aoy and Chod.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960
Breaking up with Pat makes me really upset,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960
but I also feel this relief I can’t quite explain.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.640
I’ve finally let go of the man who loves me,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
so he doesn’t have to force himself to do things for me anymore.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
May.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
Krit.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.160
I was worried about you, so I drove over to check on you.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.280
I wanted to call, but I didn’t want to cause trouble.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.440
So I parked a bit further away from Pat’s place.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.280
What’s wrong?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Where are you going?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.240
I’m not sure yet.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.160
I was just about to get a taxi.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440
Why don’t you come with me?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040
It's okay, May.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040
It's okay.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.240
I'm here for you.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.440
When we were taking pre-wedding photos,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.960
and I saw you in a wedding dress,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.600
I was so happy.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800
May.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.680
- Pat. - Where should we do it?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.560
- Hey. - Right here.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.200
I let go of the man who loves me

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.000
and chose to start over with the man I love.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.720
I just hope my decision

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.760
is the right one.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.680
(One Month Later)

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Are you still thinking about it?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200
Yes.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.680
Has Pat contacted you at all?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920
Not at all.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.160
He’s probably really mad at me.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.480
But I understand.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.920
Even if he never wants to talk to me,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.920
I still want to be friends. We’ve known each other for so long.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040
But I won’t reach out.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.800
It’s better this way.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.520
Don't overthink it.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.680
It’ll all get better someday.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
Give him some time.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.040
Most importantly,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.800
give yourself some time too.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720
Smile, May.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.200
Today is your special day.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.840
I want you to be happy.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.040
Happy birthday again.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.320
Happy birthday to you

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.000
Happy birthday to you

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.440
Happy birthday, happy birthday

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.360
Happy birthday to you

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.840
Happy birthday, Sexy May.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.240
We wish you happiness.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920
Thank you.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.639
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.920
Happy birthday.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.639
Don’t forget our bonuses.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.960
That's right.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.120
Yes!

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.880
Happy birthday, May.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.320
I wish you happiness.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.760
I'll always care about you.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.120
We'll get going.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.160
See you at the office.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.079
Bye.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.959
- Bye. - Bye.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960
- Get home safely. - Bye.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320
Bye.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.880
You told me you needed some time to think.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.280
I think it’s time to make a decision.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.920
You might act like everything’s normal,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.680
but everyone can see what’s going on between us.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440
I know

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.000
it might be a bit soon,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.080
but I want you to move on.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.760
I want to see you happy.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.880
Will you start over with me?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I promise

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.920
I'll take good care of you.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240
Okay.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.600
Ever since I decided to date Krit,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.240
he asked me to move in.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.000
I can tell he’s serious about our relationship.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.400
I’m becoming happier and happier.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.840
It feels like I made the right decision to be with someone I love

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.680
rather than someone who loves me.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.760
Pat.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.320
What are you doing here?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.240
I’m here to pick up my last paycheck.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.920
But don’t worry.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.560
I won’t have to come here anymore.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.760
Happy belated birthday.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600
How are you?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.480
Good.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.360
Thank you.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560
Bye.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.840
Hello.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.880
My ID card?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
I totally forgot.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.960
I'll come back and get it.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.880
So, everything’s done?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080
All these documents...

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880
- May won’t... - Shh.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.840
Just ask May to sign them quickly.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.400
Okay.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.040
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.640
Who’s calling you? You can take it.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960
It's fine.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.040
The number’s unfamiliar. I won’t answer.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.840
My friend dropped by with the documents to sign.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.160
The bar contract we talked about the other day.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.760
The accounting team is waiting on them, so he stopped by.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.120
Okay, I’ll sign them quickly.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.920
(Partnership Agreement)

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.920
The second partner.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.960
Here you go.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.280
All done. I’ll take care of the rest, don’t worry.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800
Thank you so much.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.120
Krit.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.240
Here.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.280
It's a check for five million baht. I said that I'd help with

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.600
the amount your friend cheated you out of.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.520
- May. - Take it.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.440
I really want to help.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280
Thank you so much.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.240
- Excuse me. - Yes?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.560
Can I ask you something?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.600
Who’s the owner of this bar?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.919
I came here once and really enjoyed it.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.400
I’m interested in buying some shares.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.520
The bar owner’s name is Krit.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.800
Many of his friends are partners.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.640
Do you know anyone called Sexy May?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.400
Oh, she’s Krit’s girlfriend.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.560
Is she a partner too?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.120
I’m not sure.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480
I see.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.080
Thank you.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.240
Krit.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.480
So, what did May say about the documents?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960
She didn’t say anything,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480
but she already signed them.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.760
What?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.360
She's not suspicious at all.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120
We’ll talk later.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440
Thanks.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560
Let's order.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200
What do you want?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I...

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.000
I need to use the restroom.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.480
Sure.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.120
Pat.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.640
Pat, what are you trying to do?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.960
What do you mean?

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.280
You don’t even like going to bars, so why are you here?

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.200
You came to see me at the office on purpose, didn’t you?

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.720
When you called me, it’s not that I didn’t want to talk to you.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.000
But the more you do this, the guiltier I feel. Don’t do this.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600
Okay.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.240
I admit it, I wanted to see you.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.560
But I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.200
I’m sorry if I did.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.040
Stop it, Pat. Don't apologize to me.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.480
I’m the one who was wrong. You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.200
But if you want us to get back together,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.040
I don’t want to hurt you again.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680
I know that.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.240
I just want you to know

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.600
that meeting you at the office was really a coincidence.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.560
I went to pick up my check.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.280
I called you because I wanted to warn you.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.400
But meeting you here

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
was intentional.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.080
I was suspicious about Krit, so I came.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.600
What do you mean?

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.920
I want to warn you.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.880
If you plan to invest in this bar, check everything carefully.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.520
Pat.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.640
Krit’s not a bad person, don’t worry.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.320
I knew

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.080
you wouldn’t believe me.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.040
Just ask May to sign them quickly.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.360
Krit.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.560
So, what did May say about the documents?

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.480
She didn't say anything, but she already signed them.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.600
She's not suspicious at all.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.520
We'll talk later.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.320
It’s nothing, Pat.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.760
That’s just how Krit talks to his friends.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.280
Honestly, May.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.000
The day you moved out and Krit was waiting for you.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520
He saw me,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.920
and the look in his eyes wasn’t trustworthy.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.480
Krit’s not a bad person.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.760
I know what you’re thinking,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.560
but please don’t think badly of him.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.920
I know you’ll never believe me,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.840
but please, May.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.240
I’m really suspicious about this.

00:18:50.241 --> 00:18:51.479
I don’t want anything bad to happen to you.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.480
Please believe me.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.959
I’m not helping you because I want us to get back together.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.480
I know that’s impossible.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520
You know

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.920
I truly wish you well.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.520
There's no hidden agenda.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720
I’m just worried about you,

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.640
and I always will be.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.200
I ordered wine for you.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.320
Thank you.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.200
Let's drink.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720
Cheers.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320
Work problems?

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.640
You seemed stressed when were at the bar.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600
No.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.320
I'll take a shower.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.240
Sure.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.280
May, we'll get going.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.520
- Sure. - Okay.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.080
Bye, see you.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Bye.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600
Do you want to leave?

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.440
Sure.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.400
I’m feeling a little dizzy. Let me go freshen up.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080
Sure.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.000
May must really trust you.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
She invested millions because of you.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.480
Right now, whatever you want to do,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.000
she'll sign the papers without a second thought.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080
She loves me.

00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:24.560
What if she finds out you were never cheated,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.560
that you lied to her for money?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.360
Do you think she’ll still love you if she finds out?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640
I can’t help it.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.560
- I have my reasons. - All you have are excuses.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120
May.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440
Yes?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.000
You still haven’t showered?

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.760
I don’t want to shower alone.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880
Want to join me?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440
Let’s shower together.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.520
Krit.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.600
Krit, I can walk there myself.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.640
No, I’ll carry you.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.840
Krit.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.360
Come on, Krit.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.160
Have you done this with anyone?

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040
Because of love,

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.880
I decided to overlook the fact that he wasn’t honest about money.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.160
I believed he must’ve really needed it,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.720
and that it wasn’t anything more than that.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.040
I’ve chosen the man I love,

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.360
so I must choose to trust him. Right, Aoy and Chod?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.680
I chose to stay with him,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.880
the man I love and am happy with.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.240
That you lied to her for money?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.320
Do you think she’ll still love you if she finds out?

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640
I can't help it.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760
I have my reasons.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.080
All you have are excuses.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.800
May.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680
Nop.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.640
Be careful with what you’re about to do.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.880
Don’t ask me questions. Just do as I say,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.920
or I’m doomed.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.880
Are you heading to the office?

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720
Yes.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.880
I want to talk to you about something.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.520
I told you that my friend cheated me out of money,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.000
but it was actually a misunderstanding.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.320
He didn’t do it.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.840
He thought the money was his.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.840
I was so drunk, I don’t even know what I said.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.560
Someone might’ve misunderstood my intentions

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.160
and thought I was trying to scam you.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.200
I don’t even know how to explain it to them.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.160
But...

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.520
I want you to know

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.080
that I didn’t scam you.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.120
The money you gave me

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.920
will be used to manage cash flow in the bar.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.600
I’ll return it to you as soon as possible.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720
It's fine, Krit.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.880
You can do whatever you want with that money.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.240
I really just want to help.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520
Thank you.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.760
Thank you so much, May.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520
You're welcome.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.600
- See you at the bar. - Sure.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.840
Yes.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.800
You've checked in?

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.480
Okay, see you.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680
Hello, May.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280
Pat.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.320
I have something to tell you about Krit.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.720
Did you find out something?

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.200
It’s nothing.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.280
He’s a good person.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.360
That’s not true.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
I don’t believe it.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.440
I know him well.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.840
Pat.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.400
You don’t have to take care of me anymore.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.120
Go start over with your life

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.240
without me.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.960
I want to see you happy.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040
And...

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.120
I’m going to start over with my life too.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.680
But if you’re worried about me,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.000
I want you to know that I’m happy.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.960
Don’t worry about me.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.800
I have to go now, Pat.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.200
May.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.080
I just arrived. I'm walking to the bar.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640
See you.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.279
So, the bar's counter will be here.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.879
This slide shows some great spots to take photos.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.640
And this is the DJ booth.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.760
Here’s the design for the Halloween party.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.520
Great, it's interesting.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.439
- Let’s go with this. - Sure.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.280
I want everyone to try the drinks

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.840
and pick the one that’s most suitable for the party.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.480
Try them,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.040
and then we’ll comment and decide afterward.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400
Okay.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.280
Please excuse me.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.200
Sexy May, the accounting team needs Krit's ID card again.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.080
All done.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.480
I'll prepare the documents outside.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.440
Are you heading back to the office?

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480
Yes.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.840
What about you?

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.160
I’ll be here. My friend’s bringing a new client over for a meeting.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.440
It might take a while.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800
Don’t wait up.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080
See you at home.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.880
Sure, see you.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240
Okay.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.680
Krit.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640
Are you done with work?

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.640
Yes, I'll go home soon.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.880
Are you at the bar?

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.400
Yes.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.000
Get home safely. See you at home.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.680
I'm bored, Krit.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.440
Can I wait for you at the bar?

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.560
Well...

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.560
My friend's bringing a new client over for a meeting.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.639
Maybe next time,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.440
when it's just me and my friends.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480
Sure.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.920
I'll wait for you at home.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.600
Okay, see you.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.080
I won again.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.280
- Let's go. - Let's do it again.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.120
Let's go.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680
You're horrible.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.200
May helped you because she felt sorry you got scammed.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.480
But you’re gambling her money away.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.960
So what? I just got another five million.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.320
That makes it ten million in total

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.200
from my beloved May.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.760
Wow.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.320
Is she really that rich?

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880
I don’t think so.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.480
How much more does she have to spend on you?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040
That’s not all I want.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.520
The power of attorney she signed for me...

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.200
I can do a lot with that.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800
If one day she finds out

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.200
and ends up in debt, it’ll be too late.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.800
I’ll have someone take over her company and sell it off cheap.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.400
And if she finds out you were the one who set this whole scam up,

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120
what are you going to do?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.480
I’ll tell her

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.800
that I got scammed too.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.760
She won’t say anything

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.960
because she loves me.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.320
She loves you, yet you’re doing all this just because you hate her ex.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.720
You are...

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.240
so ruthless.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.440
Watch your mouth.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.440
I won, see that?

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.840
I’m really sorry, but I can’t give you an extra key card.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.560
If you can’t reach Krit, I can call him for you.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.640
It's fine.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.320
- I’ll call him, thank you. - No problem.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480
May.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.880
What are you doing here?

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.919
I was just asking the hotel staff for some information.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.400
I need to send it to a client.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.160
Are you done with your meeting?

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.319
Not yet. I just came down to grab something from the car.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.520
I saw you, so I walked over.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.120
I’m heading back up.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640
Would you like to join?

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.640
You’ve met all my friends already.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.640
But it’s just the guys.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.640
If you don’t mind, come join me.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200
It’s fine.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.440
I don’t want to bother you. Go back to your meeting, I’ll head home.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.120
See you at home.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560
Okay.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.080
You said this is the last round.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.040
Triple queen.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.880
Ten thousand baht each, pay up.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.680
I got seven, yet I lost again.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.680
Wow.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.520
Let's go home.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.640
Okay.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640
Cheers.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200
Buy me food.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.560
Bottoms up.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.320
Come on. If you're broke, go home.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.920
See you at the next match.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.200
Next match? I’m broke.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.879
- See you. - See you.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880
Get home safely.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760
Hey.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800
Yes.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.720
You've checked in?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Okay, see you.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.200
May.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.080
I just arrived. I'm walking to the bar.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600
See you.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.880
I waited for so long. I’ve missed you.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.000
You flew here without telling me.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.480
I promised to play cards with my friends. I’m sorry.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.440
It's okay.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.600
I wanted to surprise you.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.160
And...

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.240
What about that woman?

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120
It’s fine.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.680
I told her I had a meeting with a client.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.280
Pim.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.800
- Daddy. - Yes?

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.640
Are you still up, Pim?

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.040
I heard your voice and got excited, so I came out to see you.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.680
How have you been? Did you miss me?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.840
Give me a big hug.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.760
Kiss me on the cheek.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
One more time.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.080
Come on, let's go in.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680
Let's go.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.760
You’re up late tonight.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.440
Really late.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.880
No matter how hard you try to lie to yourself,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.680
the truth will always come out.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.440
Just wait a little longer.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.800
Once I have the money to settle everything,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.080
you,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.480
our child,

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960
and I

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.640
will finally get to start a happy new life.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120
Wait.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.880
I know who you are.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.280
I know who you are too.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.120
(Power of Attorney)

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040
May.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.280
Did you find out something?

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.440
It's nothing. He's a good person.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.160
That's not true. I don't believe it.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.520
Walk here and then hide.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.039
Walk past this.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.439
I can't see him.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.799
- I show up again. - He goes to another room.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.599
You see a woman

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.080
and a child there.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.120
What about that woman?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.280
She's there.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.360
She's watching us.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.360
There.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.480
She's watching us.
