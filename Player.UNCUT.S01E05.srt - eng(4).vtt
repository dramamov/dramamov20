- (Previously on "Player")
- If you want to know about Phe, get in.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.400
Thanks for saving me again.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.880
Ploy probably knows more
about Phetai than we thought.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.840
I’ve come this far.
There’s no turning back now.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.840
Whatever happens… I’ll deal with it.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.520
If you fall for your target,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.520
your million baht will vanish in a heartbeat.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.240
Some chances, once missed, are gone for good.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.640
The right one for you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.760
might only come once in a lifetime.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.440
Guess I’ll have to
propose to you soon.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.400
"Just admit it already."

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.920
“You’ve got feelings for her.”

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.800
“It’s not that I love winning that much.”

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.080
Let me show you how adults do it.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.440
"So..."

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.840
"Does that mean I win?"

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.040
Mom, there’s too much chilli
in this Pad Krapow (Thai basil stir-fry).

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.280
Can you make an omelette for me, please?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.400
Ploy, I’m in a rush right now.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Can you just eat what’s already there?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.680
But spicy food always gives me a stomachache.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.440
If you can’t handle spicy food,
then just pick the chillies out.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.200
And if you want an omelette today,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.360
there’s no time. We’re in a hurry, got it?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.200
Ouch!

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.600
“I only learned what love means”

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.920
“by never having it.”

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.080
– Oh.
– Phe.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.160
– So it really is Pad Krapow.
– Yep.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.440
Smells all the way upstairs.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.080
“So this is what love feels like;”

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
“the kind Mom shows to my brother.”

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.400
The chilli smells so strong today.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.280
I kept sneezing while cooking.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.880
– Thanks, Mom.
– Is it good?

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.920
Is your mom coming today?

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.080
Oh? Why not?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.040
You won the Mother’s Day
poem contest today.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.080
Mom’s busy with work.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.560
I can go up and get the prize alone
like every other time.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.360
Then today, I’ll stay with you instead
as your stand-in mom, okay?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.160
It’s alright, really.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.760
Thank you, teacher.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.840
“There’s no one else.”

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.360
“Only me, to take care of myself.”

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560
“Because if I don’t,”

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400
“no one else will.”

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.160
“That’s right.”

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.840
“Mom taught me the meaning of love”

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.360
“by forcing me to love myself.”

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.280
“Have you checked
the email I sent you yet?”

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.160
Um, not yet.
I just parked the car.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.720
I’ll open it now, give me a sec.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.839
“Regarding the relationship between
Mr. Phetai and Miss Ploy Pitcha that you asked about.”

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.600
“They’re half-siblings, same mother
but different fathers.”

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.560
“Their mother, Mrs. Pojaman,
has been married three times.”

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.080
“Her current husband is
a businessman named Chainarong.”

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.560
“They also had another daughter, named Pailin.”

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.080
“But she passed away.”

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.159
“I’ve located Mr. Phetai’s most recent address,”

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.400
“and I managed to get this photo.”

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.640
“It seems Phetai’s been
in contact with another man.”

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.920
Who’s Phe talking to?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.200
Golf.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.920
Hey!

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.920
Golf!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.680
– Calm down. I’m not here to hurt you.
– Just go!

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.920
– I’m not the bad guy.
– I’m calling the police!

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.960
– Wait! Listen!
– I mean it!

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.240
– Hear me out!
– You’ll end up behind bars!

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.880
– Pun!
– Better start learning prison slang!

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.440
Ouch!

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.880
No!

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.360
Stay with your breath, Golf.
Focus on your breathing.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.600
Inhale...

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.040
Concentrate.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.880
1...

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.480
Please, Pun.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.560
I just came to talk to you
about Phetai.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.240
He took my money too.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.160
Huh?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.200
You want to do it this way?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.560
Yep. That’s the best way.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.120
No need for social distancing.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.720
I don’t have COVID.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.640
But you are a bad guy.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.800
I admit it.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.920
But I’ve changed, Pun.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.080
Ever since that day,
I’ve realized I’ve got issues with anger.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.240
I even paid for therapy sessions,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.560
went to the temple,
started meditating,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.520
– and...
– Come on!

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.240
Just say what you came to say.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.080
And explain this photo too.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.680
I can’t see it.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.200
Hmm.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.120
Still can’t see.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.400
This.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.240
Oh, right.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.560
I dug into Phetai’s background
and found out he’s got a sister named Ploy Pitcha.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.000
Just don’t cause any more trouble for now, okay?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120
“So I planned to talk to Ploy Pitcha,”

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.760
“and luckily, I ran into him here.”

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.760
Golf!

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.600
Where’s my half a million?!

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.760
Damn it!

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.320
Look at me, man.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.560
Give me a little more time, please.
Just a bit, dude.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.960
I’ll get the money, I swear.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.360
How the hell am I supposed to believe you?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.120
- You’ll vanish again!
- Okay, okay. Let go, calm down!

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.120
Alright, alright.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.600
Come on, just give me a little more time.
I do have some, but I…

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.280
I just wanted to make a bit more.
Alright, alright. I’ll give it to you.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.440
Come inside first, dude.
It’s in there.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.520
Come on, go ahead.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280
You son of a bitch, Phe!

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.000
Golf, let me go!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.280
– Give me my half a million back!
– I told you, I don’t have it! Look at me!

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.360
Damn it!

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.080
Soon as the deadline hit,
you planned to run, didn’t you?

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.760
Ouch!

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.280
Phe!

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200
Stop right there!

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.360
Follow him!

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.360
I’ve been waiting for a customer,
and no one’s shown up yet.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.960
Been waiting a while now.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.440
Hey, hey, go-go, now!

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.840
– Go! Hurry up!
– I’ll call you later!

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.800
Go! Forget about that, just go!

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.720
– Come on, Go! Go!
– Where are you going?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.720
Just go first! He’s coming. Hurry!

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.360
Phe!

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.640
Could it be…
that the key Ploy gave was for Phetai

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.840
to help him find a new hiding place?

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.760
That’s why I came to see you, Pun.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.760
Ever since I found out about Ploy Pitcha,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.920
I figured you were talking to her
to dig up something about Phe.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.080
I don’t want to
investigate Ploy anymore.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.840
You don’t want to?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.960
So it’s true, isn’t it?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.960
You were talking to Ploy Pitcha

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.320
to get information on Phetai.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.000
Weren’t you?

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.520
Weren’t you!?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.840
Weren’t you!?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.440
Yeah, but Ploy doesn’t know anything,
okay?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.560
How could she not? She gave him the key!

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.080
They’re siblings, aren’t they?

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.000
Maybe she just wanted
to help her brother, that’s all.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.080
You protect her?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.040
You protect her like that?
Don’t tell me...

00:09:59.400 --> 00:09:59.880
Hmm?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.360
Am I right?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.560
It’s none of your business.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.160
Please, Pun.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.760
Don’t you want your money back?

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.320
Of course I do.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.960
But maybe, there's another way.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.160
Think carefully, Pun.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.080
Think about it.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.200
What’s the most important thing right now?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.040
Mhm. I squeezed
some orange juice for you, Ploy.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.600
Thank you.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.240
You came all this way just for that?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.680
I just wanted to say...

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.320
I miss you.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.760
Well then...

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.680
I should get going.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.800
Wait.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.080
Flirting like that;
what are you up to?

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.560
Ploy, can I ask you one question?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.840
“Think carefully, Pun.”

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.200
“Think about it.”

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.920
“What’s the most important thing
right now?”

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.400
So, what did you want to ask me?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.240
Uh…

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.360
“Damn it, I can’t do this.”

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.880
Between ten Puns and a ten-year-old Pun,
which one would you choose?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.840
“What kind of ridiculous question is that?”

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.440
But you’re almost ten already, aren’t you?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.480
Ploy!

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.720
I’m not a kid, you know.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.560
Then if you were turning ten,
what would you want for your birthday?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.680
Oh, there are so many things!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.960
But how did you even know
that my birthday’s coming up?

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.280
It’s because I pay attention.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.320
What’s the best gift
you’ve ever received, Pun?

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.760
I can’t really think of one.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.040
I think I like everything I’ve ever been given.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.680
What about you, Ploy?
What’s your favourite gift?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.760
Probably something my brother gave me.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.640
Then tonight,
I’ll give you a hug as your birthday gift.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.200
Okay?

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.720
🎵 Happy birthday to you 🎵

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.840
– Go on, blow out the candles!
– Don’t forget to make a wish!

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.240
Yeah!

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.800
– Hope you’re really happy, my dear.
– Wishing you all the happiness in the world.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.160
Lots of luck and success, sis!

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.680
– Sure.
– Come on, let me help you.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.200
Finally home, huh?
My dear daughter.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.640
If it weren’t your birthday,
you probably wouldn’t have come back at all.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.960
Come on, she’s home now.
Why are you still complaining?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.640
I’m not complaining.
Just feeling left out.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.200
You came back to Thailand
without even telling your dad.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.000
I only found out from Prang.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.880
So, what brings you back this time?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.560
Well…

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.920
To gain more experience, Dad.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.520
And I actually got a job too!

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.160
– Wow, that’s amazing, sweetheart.
– That’s great.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.600
But don’t rush through life, dear.
Take things one step at a time.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.000
Kids these days
want to get rich too fast.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.080
– Don’t you think?
– True.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.560
What about you two?
How’s the relationship going?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.600
Dad! Not here, please.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.280
– You know, it’s legal to get married now.
– That’s right.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.320
– So, when’s the wedding?
– Yeah!

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.000
(laughs)

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.320
How are you holding up, Pun?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.680
I’m fine as always.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.720
Then why are you sitting here alone?

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.400
Not having fun?

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.240
Of course, I am.
Everyone put in so much effort for my birthday.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.520
Pun.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.680
Are you broke?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.080
What? Broke?
What are you even talking about, Prang?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.160
You suddenly came back out of nowhere.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.640
Or is there another reason?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.800
Reason? I already told you
when we were having dinner.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.600
Besides,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.000
You just
gave me a million, Prang.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.720
How could I possibly spend it all that fast?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.600
Then, is it something else?

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.320
It’s nothing.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.640
Pun, everyone just wants
to help you, you know?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.080
But we can’t, unless you open up to us.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.480
There’s really nothing.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.480
And even if there was,
I can handle it myself.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.760
Don’t worry about me, Prang.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.560
What are you two whispering about?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.000
Oh, Jay, perfect timing!

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.680
I’ll get going then.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.400
You two can have your lovey-dovey time.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.960
Are you okay?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.840
I’m here, Ploy!

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.520
Surprise!

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.400
The crown is yours!

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.200
Queen of the night!

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.640
- The crown has landed!
- Get over here!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.840
Come quick!

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.360
🎵 Happy birthday to you 🎵

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.560
Blow them out!

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.200
Yay!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.120
I’ve got a present for you.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.920
Aww, that’s so sweet.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.520
I’ve got one too.
Mine’s even better than Best’s! Look!

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.520
I bet you’ll love mine the most, Pun!

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.560
Wow, thank you!

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.920
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks!

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.760
- Come on, let’s go over there!
- I don’t want to.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.280
Move!

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.760
Alright.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.480
This one’s from me.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.560
Why a butterfly?

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.120
You said you’ve been into butterflies lately.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.280
Like those paper ones
you folded in your room.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.680
Cheers!

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.880
I’ll start first.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.200
How many siblings do you have, Ploy?

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.840
One older brother and one younger sister.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.320
Different fathers, different surnames.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.360
Only people close to me know that.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.600
I want to know about your first kiss.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.360
My freshman year.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.480
In a car.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.840
With a guy or a girl?

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.280
One question at a time, Ploy.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.920
You’ll have to wait for your next turn.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.720
It’s part of the same question.
You didn’t answer completely.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.600
You’re cheating, Ploy.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.880
Female.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Then I also want to know
about your first kiss.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.600
11th grade, in a science classroom.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.360
Starting young, huh?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.440
It’s called learning fast.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.760
My turn.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.760
I want to know how you felt
when you kissed me that night.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.200
Which of your exes took your virginity?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.120
And how do you even know I’m not a virgin?

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.520
Are you drinking, or answering?

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.240
(coughs)

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.400
I don’t want to play anymore.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.600
Then one last question.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.920
What’s the highest number of people
you’ve ever dated at the same time?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.240
I’ve never two-timed anyone.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.400
Two.
I once dated two people at the same time.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.000
Only two?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.400
I don’t like liars, you know.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.840
Six.
I’ve dated six people at once.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.320
Six? Seriously?

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.520
Now you know.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.360
Do you see me differently?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120
Pun.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.840
I can smell fermented fish.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.640
And I can smell onions.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.120
Has anyone ever told you

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.720
that when you wake up,
you smile before you open your eyes?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.440
Maybe I smile
because I can smell you, Ploy.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.160
If you were lying here instead of me,

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.280
you’d know.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.840
The smell of alcohol from your body

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.400
has already conquered this whole room.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.240
My TV channel is having
a sports day event next week.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.840
Want some tickets?

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.760
Are you going too?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.120
Of course.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.960
Then yes, I’d love to.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.320
I’ll get seats for you
and your friends, then.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.080
Sure. I’ll be there.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.800
Ouch!

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640
I’m sorry, man.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.160
I swear, I’ll pay you back
as soon as I have the money.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.440
I want it now!

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.160
I don’t have it yet!

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.560
Phe!

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.840
“Hello everyone, and welcome
to Heart Pop Sports Day!”

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.720
“Of course, today we’ve got...”

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.520
“a very special basketball match!”

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.440
“Featuring our fabulous actresses
from Heart Pop Studio!”

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.240
“If you’re ready, let’s meet…”

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.680
“Team Pink Milk, led by Captain Jay!”

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.000
“Our gorgeous stars are here.”

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.200
“Come on. Who’s your bias?”

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.440
“Let’s hear some noise for your bias!”

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.840
Wow! The crowd’s full of energy today!

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.040
And next up, team Purple Sweet Potato,

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.680
led by Captain Ploy! Yay!

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.640
“Here comes Team Purple Sweet Potato!”

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.480
“The fans are going wild!”

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.320
“And our players are totally
winning their hearts!”

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.960
“They’re walking in
with full-on team spirit!”

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.080
“And there they are,
our stunning actresses!”

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.440
- “Let’s give them a big round of applause!”
- Go, Ploy!

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.000
Go for it!

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.200
Why aren’t you holding Ploy’s photo?

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.440
I’ve got to hold Prang’s name sign instead.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.040
If I waved Ploy’s face this big,
everyone would start suspecting something.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.760
Wait. Doesn’t she already know
you’re dating her?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.480
I thought you slipped up already!

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.680
Go, Ploy—woo!

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.920
“Now let’s give our stars a few minutes
to get ready backstage!”

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.320
What’s wrong?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.040
Nervous, Prang?

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.720
A little.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.120
Are you that nervous?

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.720
My heart’s pounding so hard.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.240
Here, Prang,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.440
I can feel that now.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.160
Prang, give me a little comfort.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.680
There, there. Come here.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.240
- No. Comfort me more, Prang.
- There, there. Come on.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.320
What are you nervous about?
You’ve practiced enough already.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.320
I... I don’t even know why.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.600
You see people all the time.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.720
Jay.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.520
– Hi, Prang!
– Hello, Jae Ang!

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.360
Um...

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.320
Uh... I, um...

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.240
I’ll go talk to Jae Ang first, okay?
Be right back!

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.760
Okay!

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.840
What’s up with her?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.080
How’s everything, Jae Ang?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.560
All set.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.640
But Jay, are you sure about this?
It’s still not too late to back out.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.600
Oh, come on, Jae Ang. I’m sure!

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.280
Too late to change my mind now!

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.680
Okay, then get ready.
Everything’s in place.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.560
We’re all set on our end.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.640
Thanks, Jae Ang.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.040
So you’re really faking
an asthma attack for the proposal?

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.440
Don’t you think it’s a bit old-fashioned?

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.840
Nah. This one always works.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.520
Alright then. I’ll go set everything up.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.200
Go on, go, go, go!

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.880
“Jay! Jay! Jay!”

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.560
Jay!

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.200
Jay! Please stay with me.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.760
There’s no time, Prang...

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.040
Before I die, can I ask for one thing?

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.280
Anything, Jay.
You can have anything you want!

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.280
I…

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.120
I just want to ask...

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.000
Will you marry me, Prang?

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.360
[sobbing]

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.320
Yes, I will.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.760
Where have you been?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.200
Uh... well... ahem...

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.960
Umm...

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.800
What’s wrong with you?
You’re acting weird.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.160
Nothing!

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.120
I’m totally normal!

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.360
I, uh... sneaked off to eat
some crispy pork belly.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:01.920
Yeah, that’s it!

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.320
Jae Ang’s gonna blow up at you again, Jay.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.320
Don’t tell her, okay? She’ll kill me!

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.280
Shh! Promise you won’t tell!

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.440
Only crew and cast are allowed inside.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.000
I’m part of the crew.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.640
May I see your staff ID, please?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.800
My... ID?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.800
Uh... I, um...

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.000
I left it downstairs
when I went to get lunch.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.360
I just need to go in for a minute.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.040
Then could you call someone inside
to come out for you?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.440
It’s alright. She’s with me.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.760
She’s a friend of Ploy.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.680
Oh...

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.000
Ploy’s girl, right?

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.200
Come on.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.920
Thanks, Ji.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.840
Ploy’s over here.
Bring it to her.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.560
Ahem.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.680
Fresh orange juice for my gorgeous athlete.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.360
How did you get in here?

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.760
I’ve got connections.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.280
I’ll leave you two to chat.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.760
So... Do you usually sneak girls
in here like this?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.480
Who told you that?

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.800
Just now, when Ji said I was your friend,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.840
the staff let me through so easily.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.440
Pretty suspicious, if you ask me.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.240
And if that’s true…
What would you do, Pun?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.760
I’d make sure

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.520
I’m the last person
who ever gets to come see you.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.920
In that case,

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.920
I’ll issue you a VVVVVIP pass.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.120
- Deal?
- Deal.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.840
- I should get going.
- Okay.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.160
- Good luck out there.
- Got it.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.680
I’m leaving now.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.600
Mm-hm.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.320
Really leaving.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.800
Mmm-hmm.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.680
I’m actually leaving.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.960
Mmm-hmm...
Or maybe just don’t go at all.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.040
Stay here with me.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.680
- I have to go.
- Can’t you stay a bit longer?

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.320
Nope. I really have to.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240
You’ve got this!

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.240
Mhm.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320
I’m off then.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.680
Bye-bye.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.280
Ploy.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.080
How are you doing?

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.520
Are you good?

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.640
I’m okay.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.960
Ready?

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.040
Ready.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.320
Tired?

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.840
I haven’t even started yet.
I’m not tired at all.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.800
Miss Dream, could you please
check this file for me?

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.840
Sure thing, I’ll sort it out.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.080
- I’ll get going, Ploy.
- Mhm.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.679
Good luck!

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.280
Heard you used to date the producer?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.040
Are you talking to me?

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.440
Don’t you see it’s just us here?

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.960
Maybe.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.520
Don’t think just because you’ve dated her,
you can do whatever you like.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.200
Move, please. I need to get ready.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.560
Then pardon my manners.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.920
And now, it’s finally time
for our competition!

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.960
Get ready to scream your hearts out!

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.600
Jay, what’s wrong? Nervous already?

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.160
I’m fine. Nothing’s wrong.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.440
Alright then, before we begin the match,

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.440
as per our tradition,

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.400
we’ll pick one lucky fan to come down
and take the first lucky shot!

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.000
With our captain!

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.800
For the first team, the Purple Team,
Captain Ploy Pitcha!

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.960
Yay!

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.320
Go Ploy!

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.280
And of course,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.960
we’ll be doing a random draw
to find our lucky fan!

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.400
Alright, if you’re ready,
tap the screen to start!

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.320
And now, we have our lucky winner!

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.720
The number is...

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.560
R 538!

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.560
- (”R 153”)
- Are you here? Up there?

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.960
“Anyone?”

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.680
Nope.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.880
That’s me!

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.840
(”R 538”)

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.920
What? You won?

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.680
Come on, please?
Think of it as doing a good deed!

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.040
No way, this is my golden chance!

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.160
I’ll give you a hundred!

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.080
Nope!

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.920
Five hundred!

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.680
Still no!

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.040
“Are you here?”

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.640
If you are, make some noise!

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.160
Wait, a Prang fan?

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.240
But...

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.280
It’s Ploy up there.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.320
I’ll take a chance to get close to any star.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.600
“R 538, are you here?”

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.720
“If not, we’ll start counting.”

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.640
“R 538, counting one!”

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.040
I am Prang’s real sister.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.560
Real sister of Prang Punnaputch!

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.000
Forget meeting a celeb up close.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.520
I could’ve given you 10 exclusive selfie passes,

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.840
each signed by Prang!

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.000
“And now, R 538… counting two!”

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.520
“Are you here?”

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.400
Alright, it’s yours!

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.960
“If your friend’s nearby,
give them a nudge!”

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.640
“If you don’t show up,
we’ll move on!”

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.080
And R 538, counting...

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.280
I’m here!

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.400
We’ve found our lucky winner!

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.840
Please come on here!

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.040
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.400
Alright, we wait for our winner to arrive.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.240
Oh! Here she comes!

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.440
Wow, our gorgeous winner!
Let’s have a quick chat, shall we?

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.760
What’s your name?

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.880
My name is Pun.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.560
What a lovely name!

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.600
So, Pun, before we start,

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.040
anything you’d like to say
to Ploy or other stars?

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.720
I just want to say to Ploy

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.960
and Team Purple Sweet Potato: Good luck!

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.920
Oh, that’s such a basic answer!

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.480
But that’s alright!

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.880
Alright then, Ploy.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.200
Let’s help Pun take the first lucky shot!

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.920
Let’s go!

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.440
Thank you.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.080
I remember the ticket I gave you
wasn’t that number.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.120
When luck’s not on my side,

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.800
I have to make my own, don’t I?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.760
Easy now.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.240
Keep your eyes on the hoop.
Don’t look away.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.560
Honestly,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.560
your scent’s completely
messing with my focus right now, Ploy.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.440
Maybe you should aim for me instead.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.480
“Let’s see if"

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.920
- "Pun and Ploy’s lucky shot…”
- Excuse me?

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.000
You’re always aiming at my heart anyway.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.480
Is that how Gen Y flirts these days?

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.280
Just trying to help you relax.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.840
– Ready?
– Mhm.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.720
“Alright, Pun and Ploy are now getting ready to shoot!”

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.840
Eyes on the hoop.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.760
Hands up like this.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.720
Before you shoot,
bend your knees a little.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.280
- Alright?
- Okay.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280
Go for it.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.760
“Three, two, one…”

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.120
– One, two…
– “Shoot!”

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.240
“And it’s up!”

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.160
“Will it go in?”

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.280
“Will it? Will it?”

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.240
“Ah, what a shame; it missed!”

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.920
“But that’s alright!”

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.400
Sorry. I missed the shot.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.080
You did great.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.000
Who needs a lucky shot anyway?

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.280
Having you here already feels lucky enough.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.680
Why are you being so flirty today?

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.160
– Hey!
– Hey!

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.040
Yeah!

(”Team Purple Sweet Potato”)

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.400
Oh, bring it on!

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.400
You wish you’re going down first!

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.440
What?

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.000
You alright, Ploy?

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.920
You’ve got this!

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.160
Why’s Annie all over her like that?

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360
Yeah, seriously.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.600
What do we do, Pun?

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.480
Should we throw some balls at her instead?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.600
I kinda want some screen time today.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.960
Wait. You actually brought one, Krit?

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.800
Right here.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.120
Ew!

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.440
Oh!

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.800
Get every shot.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.480
If Annie tries anything,
let the internet do its thing.

– Ploy!
– Ploy!

Oh my gosh!​​

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.400
That bitch. She totally
ran into her on purpose!

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.200
– Oh! Pun!
– Pun!

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.000
– Pun!
- Pun! Hurry! Let’s follow her!

Ploy!

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.360
Ouch!

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.000
You okay, Ploy?

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.680
Hurry.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.800
Pun.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.280
Pun!

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.680
Yes, Ji.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.400
I’m alright now.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.920
What did the doctor say?

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.560
Hmm…

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.200
My knee, hip,

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.080
arm were bruised,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.600
and I’ve got a sprained ankle.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.200
Do you have to stay overnight?

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.520
I told the doctor I had a bit of a headache,

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.880
so he said I should rest here for the night.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.800
Pun, can you check
what people are saying online?

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.040
I want to know how it’s spreading.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.760
They’re saying…

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.600
even the way you fell looked graceful.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.360
And here’s another one.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.760
‘The rivalry between the lead
and the villain might be real.’

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.560
What’s going on between you and Annie?

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.960
I overheard reporters
talking about it at the event.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.720
I was just minding my own business.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.320
But Annie never liked me.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.760
Are you going to sue her?

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.560
She’ll probably apologize soon,

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.600
say it was an accident, that she didn’t mean it.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.560
Her image will take a bit of a hit,
with all the clips and gossip going around.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.520
But it’ll blow over in a few days.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.440
You’re really just going to let it go?

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.120
She hurt you.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.000
What if it had been worse?
What would I have done?

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.560
I probably smell right now.
I didn’t even wear perfume.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.160
You always smell nice to me.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.040
Don’t let your emotions get the better of you.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.840
You nearly got yourself killed,

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.000
and I have to hear about it
from the news, again?

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.720
I’m flattered you still
keep up with my headlines, Mom.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.320
How are you feeling?

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.560
Your mother and I came straight here
after we saw the news.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.920
Just a few bruises.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.480
I can still handle Mom’s lectures.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.600
Don’t worry, Dad.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.920
Why didn’t you call and tell me
you were in the hospital?

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.320
Can’t you just do what you’ve always done?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.120
You don’t have to pretend that you care.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.000
I’ve always handled my own problems.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.600
I don’t need you to interfere this time.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.240
I’d like to rest now.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.120
Ploy!

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.280
- Well.
- You’re getting out of line.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.880
I’m sorry.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.640
I’m Ploy’s neighbor.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.600
I think she really needs to rest.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.480
Could you maybe visit another day?

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.920
Are you telling me to leave?

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.600
I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.240
But the doctor really did say she needs to sleep.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:28.960
Or…

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.960
you’re welcome to wait here if you’d prefer.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.360
Come on, let’s go.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.240
Should I tell them no more visitors?

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.280
They’re all just worried about you.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.560
I just want to be alone with you.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.320
Can I have a hug?

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.520
I’m here with you.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.640
Thank you.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:09.960
So…

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.000
Are you alright with your mom?

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.480
It’s fine.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.960
I’m used to it.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.640
Ploy!

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
It’s getting late. Why aren’t you home yet?

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.160
Do I really have to come drag you back myself?

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.760
Mom, I was practicing my drum major routine.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.480
I got chosen to represent the school!

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.560
You’d be better off spending that time studying,

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.960
instead of wasting it on nonsense like this.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.840
“Mom’s never gotten over my dad leaving her.”

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.960
And don’t you ever come home this late again!

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.600
“So in her eyes,”

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.000
Go home. Do you understand?

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.040
“I’ve always been the stain
on her perfect little family.”

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.640
Grab your things and move it!

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.240
“No matter how hard I try,”

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.560
“it just won’t wash away.”

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.960
Pailin was riding the scooter you bought her.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.920
She fell,

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.800
hit her head.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.720
Do you realize what you’ve done?

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.120
But it was an accident.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.040
You’re always taking her side!

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.120
Because she never thinks before she acts!

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.200
That’s why our daughter turned out like this!

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.640
“And that stain”

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.320
“kept spreading through me like cancer.”

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.200
Pailin needs an emergency second surgery.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.160
Otherwise she’ll die.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.040
But if she survives the operation,

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.640
she’ll end up in a coma.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.760
I think you have to decide.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.360
You know what you’ve done, don’t you?

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.640
If anything happens to your sister,

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.840
I will never forgive you!

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.480
Mom, please calm down.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.800
Pailin.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.080
[sobbing]

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.720
“And two years later…”

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.440
“After fighting to keep her alive…”

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.560
In the end,

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.200
Pailin passed away.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.800
It wasn’t your fault.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.400
Why can’t they see that?

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.280
Never mind.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.440
I stopped hoping for my mom a long time ago.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.320
Let alone being loved,

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.440
I don’t even hope she’ll stop hating me.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.080
I gave up on that a while back.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.360
You deserve to be loved.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.240
To be loved properly.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.920
If no one gives it to you,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.680
I will.

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.560
Golf, what happened to your face?

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.640
I got into a fight with Phe.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.520
Phe? How did you run into him?

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.080
I went to his old place.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.440
He happened to be there
collecting his stuff, so...

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.240
we had a scrap.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.920
I’m sorry I couldn’t do more to help.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.520
By the way,

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.800
did you get anything out of it?

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:07.920
Hmm.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.920
That’s all I got.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.240
(”Loan Agreement”)

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.160
Looks like Phe racked up
a few million in debt back in the States.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.760
So he started asking people for money.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.520
No, not asking.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.600
Scamming. He’s been conning people left and right.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.440
And do you have any idea where Phetai is now?

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.720
No clue.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.320
And…

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.120
what about Ploy Pitcha?
What’s your take on her?

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.760
I knew it.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.600
I’m sure

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.120
she doesn’t know anything about the money.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.480
At most,

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.240
she probably just helped Phetai find a place to hide.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.400
That’s exactly what matters, Pun.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.840
If you’d gotten that out of her,

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.520
we’d have found him ages ago.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.600
I’m sorry.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.560
Isn’t there any other way?

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.560
Your dad…

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.880
He’s the Commissioner General, isn’t he?

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.120
Can’t he help?

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.880
I don’t want to bother him.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.960
Seriously, Pun?

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.440
Things have gone this far and you still…

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:25.760
Darn it!

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.800
Breathe.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.120
Stay with your breath.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.040
One.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.240
Two.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.640
Okay, Pun.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.840
Then tell me.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.120
Why won’t you ask your dad for help?

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.800
I’m really sorry, Golf.

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.040
Darn it!

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.920
Stay with your breath, Golf.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.400
Then I guess...

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.360
This is where the road ends, Pun.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.280
It’s not that I don’t care.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.920
That money matters to me too.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.400
But there’s really nothing I can do.

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.480
You can do something, Pun.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.200
You just choose not to.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.120
Ploy is one thing.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.240
Your dad’s another.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.720
But it’s fine.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.680
From now on, I’ll handle it on my own.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.880
I just hope you’re happy
with your Ploy Pitcha.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:34.920
Golf!

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.080
Golf!

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.320
Hmm.

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.840
This milk tea’s actually really good.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.480
If hospital duty comes with drinks like this,

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.480
I don’t mind.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.320
Jieab, all you ever care about is food.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.320
Seriously,

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.480
I’m still pissed off about Annie.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.880
Would make a perfect social media scandal, right?

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.920
These days, trends don’t last.

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.360
They just burned out.

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.840
Oh, stop talking!

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.800
I’m starting a burner account tonight.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.120
Or maybe I’ll post something cryptic on Insta

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.560
I bet by morning

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.320
the internet sleuths will tear each other apart.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.320
– Genius.
– Fabulous.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.400
You’re brilliant.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.680
- Absolutely.
- Oi, you two.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.840
Listen to me first.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.120
- What?
- What?

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.560
Did you see the girl
who got in the ambulance with Ploy?

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.360
Yeah.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.160
I think her name’s Dream.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.280
Yeah, her.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.680
She’s the daughter of Duangdao,
the producer.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.040
She’s been helping her mom on set lately.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.640
I heard rumors

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.000
she’s about to take over the next show herself.

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.880
Probably around the same age as Ploy, too.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.640
Hmm…

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.280
Wait, look! That’s her.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.840
(”Duangdao’s daughter, Dream
to be a new producer”)

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.480
Duangdao’s producing
the series Ploy’s starring in.

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.040
Maybe she was just looking after the cast.

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.760
That’s why she got in the ambulance.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.560
Why?

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.840
Are you jealous?

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.680
Jealous? Please.

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.960
Me? I don’t even know that word.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.840
Hm?

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:33.520
Not jealous, huh?
You were sprinting like crazy just now.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.240
Darn!

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.160
– Ugh!
– Sorry,

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.960
I’m starving. I haven’t eaten all day.

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.600
What about me?
I came with you, didn’t I?

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.280
– Here, there’s a crumb left!
– Ugh, Krit!

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.400
That’s not even enough to fill me up!

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.800
Here, there’s a bit left.
Open up, I’ll feed you.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.480
See?

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.040
- I’m helping you out here!
- I said no!

00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.800
“In the end,”

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.840
“everyone carries their own scars”

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.560
“even someone as perfect as Ploy Pitcha.”

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.080
“And that’s part of why I’ve come

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.800
"to love this game even more.”

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.120
“It’s not just about winning her heart.”

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.080
“I want to win against the pain

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.680
"that haunts her too.”

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.880
“Actually,”

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.960
“if this really is a game,”

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.760
“it would be strange"

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.120
"without this.”

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.760
This girl...

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.880
Your friend, Ploy?

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.280
“So, the new player has arrived.”

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.440
What’s your relationship with Prang?

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.160
My ex.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.320
That flame’s long gone.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.360
Ever sneaked a peek at my boobs?

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.520
What kind of question is that?

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.160
Just answer honestly.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.680
Have you,

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.360
or haven’t you?

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.880
I have.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.200
And when you looked,

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.360
what went through your mind?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.640
Your turn’s over.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.120
I don’t want to play anymore.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.880
Pun.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.360
I can smell fermented fish.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.520
And I can smell onions.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080
Ugh, that stinks.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.160
- (Next episode)
- Prang and I

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.760
have a shoot in Pattaya.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.240
We want to invite everyone to come along.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.560
Let everyone else get in the sea.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.600
So we can have this spot to ourselves.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.040
Are you here with friends, Ploy?

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.480
What a coincidence.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.880
I really don’t like it

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.440
when you’re with Dream.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.280
Let’s get back together, Ploy.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:06.960
(screams)

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.000
Have you ever felt jealous

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.600
when I talk to someone else?
