"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 3)

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:30.415
Okay, stop talking.

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:31.416
Do it.

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:32.576
And these.

00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:36.576
Won't you help me.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.216
Then I'll do it.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:40.936
It's okay.

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:41.936
You go on ahead.

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:55.096
A stank face so early in the morning.

00:04:10.976 --> 00:04:11.976
It's so messy.

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:13.736
Clean it up.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:23.336
I put it here for you.

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:24.376
OK, thank you.

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.136
What?

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:30.936
You've never been in a relationship?

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:32.096
You're crazy.

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:33.216
Use this.

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:43.416
Speak more kindly, why
are you so aggressive?

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:11.776
What should I do now?

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:13.096
Throw these away.

00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:20.456
Wow.

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:22.056
This smells really good

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:24.856
I felt it smelled especially good
when I took a shower in the morning.

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:26.896
It smells like some flower,

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:29.408
but I can't remember what
kind of flower right now.

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:30.736
Have a sniff.

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:32.216
Are you okay?

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.056
I'm so sorry.

00:05:33.136 --> 00:05:34.215
Let me take a look for you.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:35.296
Don't touch me.

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:37.775
But let me just take a look.

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:38.776
Don't touch me.

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:40.576
I'm so sorry.

00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:43.936
White tea.

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:17.981
Who are you?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.840
Hello

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.720
I'm an employee here.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.560
My name is Xu Jingxi.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.440
How can I help you?

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:22.465
Employee?

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.090
Why have I never seen you before?

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.720
Are you a guest or...

00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:28.345
I own this inn.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.980
Boss lady!

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:31.125
Sorry.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.960
It's just "Boss."

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:32.985
Hello, boss.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.120
I just arrived last night.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.080
Who hired you?

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.105
The sourp...

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.160
Wen Shan.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.600
Wen Shan hired me.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.359
Where is Wen Shan?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.520
Why don't I see her?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.879
She's in the lounge.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.239
She accidentally hit her head.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.000
And feel a bit dizzy

00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:48.176
I guess she's still having a rest.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200
Hit her head?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.600
Okay, I'll go see her.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.400
Okay.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480
Then do your best.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.520
Okay, boss.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640
Boss, you are so pretty.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.359
I heard you hit your head.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.360
Are you okay?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.640
I'm fine, just an accident.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440
Oh you,

00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:16.600
You get nervous at the smallest things.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.280
The person outside, who is she?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.480
The newly hired staff

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.160
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.040
What kind of person is she?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.960
She doesn't look like a college student.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.160
I don't know.

00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:30.519
She came to check in yesterday.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.319
And said she lost her phone and ID card.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.840
I thought let her work
to pay off the room fee.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.440
Wen Shan, have you gotten
stupid from your head injury?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.239
You let her stay without an ID?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.440
You don't even know
who she is and you just took her in.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.280
It's better safe than
sorry when running an inn.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.360
What if she ran away from a marriage?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.120
What if she's an illegal immigrant?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.040
You should never intent to hurt people, but
never drop your guard.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320
Am I right?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.760
One hundred yuan per day.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.400
Meal and accommodation provided.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400
Isn't that fine?

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.880
Oh, I see.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.879
I think that girl is quite nimble.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.360
She's pretty, too.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.640
She shouldn't be a bad person.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.039
Didn't you say you were
going to hang out with Qiu Bei?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.320
Why are you still in the inn?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.400
This is my inn

00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:12.215
I come whenever I want, are you my keeper?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.160
Don't mention Qiu Bei to me, anyway

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.640
I get angry when you mention her.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.719
It's not easy to get into the off-season.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.640
There aren't many guests

00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:19.719
I told her yesterday.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.416
Let's go out and have
fun for a couple days.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.680
You know what she told me?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.760
She told me she was busy and couldn't leave.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.239
As if my inn wasn't busy.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.360
Why can I leave?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.360
She said I had you to help me.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.919
So what, am I supposed
to pay to take care of you?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.336
You also have to look after her bar.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.560
Her bar would actually
have to close without her.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.880
Then let it close!

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.440
There's never enough money.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.560
Besides.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.440
How much could that bar of hers even make?

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.920
Okay.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.080
You're right.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.480
You don't have to be appease me like that.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.120
What's her name?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.160
Xu Jingxi.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.080
Xu Jingxi.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.799
It's still an issue that
she doesn't have her ID.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.200
You'd better investigate it clearly.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.480
She can't do this job forever.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.080
Yes

00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.239
I'll contact the police station.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.760
She'll go to register in the afternoon.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840
Okay.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.176
That damn Qiu Bei,
she makes me so angry that my head hurts.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.440
I'll be in the back for a while.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840
What's for lunch?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480
Tomato and egg.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.880
OK

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120
I'll go.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.560
Be careful, it's hot.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360
Put it here.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.400
Sis Yun.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.240
You guys eat first

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.960
I'm going out for a while.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.960
Okay.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.439
Go call the newbie to eat.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440
OK

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.840
Not ready yet?

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880
Ready.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.400
Come on.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400
Come on quickly.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.519
Xiao Xu.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.520
Xu Jingxi.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.280
OK

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280
Jingxi, come and sit.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.680
Come and try Wen Shan's cooking.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.639
Noodles with gravy

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.400
I didn't know Sourpuss
could cook like this.

00:10:07.735 --> 00:10:08.655
Sourpuss?

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680
Who?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.920
Wen Shan.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.240
That's actually pretty accurate.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.640
Come on, no need for manners here.

00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:16.800
Eat and serve yourself.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880
Thank you, boss.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.200
Don't thank me, I didn't cook.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360
Xiao Xu.

00:10:22.415 --> 00:10:23.576
How many people are there in your family?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Where are you from?

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.840
Why are you here?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.079
Many young people come here

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.176
either because they are heartbroken
or they are looking for true love.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.080
Why are you here?

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.320
I am...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.760
Are you checking her
household registration?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.120
I wasn't asking you.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.399
I was employed.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.439
Now I lost my job

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.240
I came out to travel.

00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:41.800
But I lost my phone and ID card.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600
So that's how it is.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.679
Why did you come alone?

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680
Where is your partner?

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.360
I've never been in a relationship.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.880
You have never had
someone you like in your life?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.600
Someone I like...

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.919
Not really.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.440
Maybe it's just not the right time yet.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.640
Besides, no one likes me.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.360
You are such a pretty
girl, but no guys like you.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.280
It's normal if you say
no guys like Wen Shan.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.320
But if no guys like you,
then they must be blind.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.720
What's wrong with me?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.480
You are so nice.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.759
Incredibly nice.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.919
Especially the noodles you cook.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920
So great.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.200
Boss.

00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:24.199
But I didn't expect you to be so real.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.040
And you get along so
well with your employees.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.280
There aren't many people at all.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.000
Why should I make myself high and mighty?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.319
Not like you working in the big city office.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.160
Brown-nosing is a survival skill.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.200
Otherwise you'd burn out every day.

00:11:36.455 --> 00:11:38.655
If it isn't the office politics,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.520
then its the boss abusing their power.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.480
What place could be more
comfortable than here?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.096
How did you nail every single detail?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.640
Boss, you've worked before?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
How about you?

00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:50.080
Now that you're here, just give your best.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.719
I see you're quite skillful.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.119
If there's anything you don't understand.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120
Just ask Wen Shan.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.080
After your ID card is issued,
you should travel around.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.760
Once you've had fill of fun, you
must go back to work properly.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.520
Us women,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.400
we need to have our own jobs.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.959
Only when you are financially
independent can you not rely on anyone.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.320
Do you understand?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320
You are right.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.160
I'm a woman too.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.200
You're a woman.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.600
Just not friendly enough, we
can never be close in this lifetime.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.879
Look at me and Xiao Xu.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.600
Like old friends from first glance.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.280
We'll be able to talk all night in two days.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.280
Not like you.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.040
It's like you seeing a ghost
when I get close to you.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.200
Are you okay?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.359
Let me take a look for you.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.520
Don't touch me.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.760
Your shoulders are probably rusty.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.560
Try this.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.720
Come on.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.640
Add more gravy.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640
OK

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.680
Let me try.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680
Try it.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.080
It's delicious.

00:12:49.216 --> 00:12:51.696
No matter how delicious it is,
you can't eat it for a whole month.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.280
If you don't like it, just don't eat it.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.839
Can you cook some food differently?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.120
Ask Qiu Bei to cook for you.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.560
Who is Qiu Bei?
