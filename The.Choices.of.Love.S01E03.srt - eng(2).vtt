(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers)

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.400

(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.800
What are you doing here?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800
I’m applying for a job
at your company.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480
It’s nice to have Pat help out.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.080
I'm glad we're partners.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.160
Likewise.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.680
Hello.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120
I'm worried about you.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.200
Don't overthink about us.
Good night.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.640
You said you were in a hurry.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.120
You should go, or you’ll be late.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.120
I’ll come back as soon as I’m done.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.120
You said you were going to spend
the night there.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.680
Why would you drive home
after a long day? It’s dangerous.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640
Krit.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.400
Pat's house looks nice and cozy.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.080
But...

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.360
Your heart's probably not here.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760
You should be honest
with your feelings.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.760
It'll be better for everyone,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.880
for both you and Pat.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320
It's not too late

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.720
to rethink your decision.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.480
Do you mind leaving, Krit?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.360
I feel a little sick.
I want to rest.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.560
Are you all right?
Do you want me to stay with you?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.280
It's okay. I'm fine on my own.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920
Okay.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.760
Call me if you need anything.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.120
Thank you.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.080
Krit.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.800
About us...

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.920
Don't worry about it.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
I can wait.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.120
You must be
really confused right now.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.640
I'm sorry
for making you feel that way.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.480
But the more confused you are,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360
the more you'll realize
what you need to do about Pat.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.760
You're just not ready yet.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.240
I completely understand.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.480
I know

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.520
that breaking up with someone

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.000
you’re about to marry

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.120
isn’t easy.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.680
But like I said,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.160
I can wait for you.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
I’ll always be here,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600
no matter what.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.680
Don’t overthink it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.080
I’ll always be here

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.720
for you.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680
I'll get going then.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880
Okay.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.920
Marry me.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.720
I promise

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.560
I’ll take good care of you.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.080
I think

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.000
you and I have a lot in common.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.280
Besides, I know

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520
how you feel

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.520
about me.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760
I like you, May.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.880
Pat.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.480
How were you last night?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.120
Last night...

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.440
What do you mean?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.000
You were sick, weren’t you?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.520
Like I said, I’m fine.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040
Good.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440
Pat.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080
Yes?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Do you have something

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200
to tell me?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560
Well...

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.880
I’m a little stressed out
about work.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.840
But it’s okay, I can handle it.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.840
I just wanted to tell you

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.000
I’m going out
to pitch to a client today.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.000
You don’t need to come
to the office.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080
Good luck.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Are you thinking about last night?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.720
Let’s not talk about that here.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.360
If you’re planning to come
see me again here,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.640
please let me know beforehand.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800
May.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760
I'm sorry.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.640
I don’t really know
what to do either.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.120
If I call you, I’m afraid

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.080
you might be with Pat
and it will cause you trouble.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.640
So I decided to come here instead,
since we discuss work here anyway.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.200
Pat won’t find it suspicious.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520
Is he back?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.880
How is he? Isn’t he at work?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440
Or...

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560
Did you guys get into a fight?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880
No.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.480
There’s nothing for him to do now,
so I told him not to come in.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.200
He came back this morning.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.320
I feel so guilty when I see him.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.800
I don’t know

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.320
what I’m supposed to do.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
May.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.240
It's okay. It really is.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.240
Don't overthink it.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.440
I know

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.440
you’re trying your best

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440
to make things right.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.160
It’s not easy, is it?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.840
Like I said, no matter what happens,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.120
I’ll wait for you here.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040
Take your time.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.160
I have to go see a client.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240
Pat.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.000
I thought you were pitching
to a client.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.680
Why are you with Krit?

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.360
Is this about work?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.880
Why didn’t you invite me?

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.600
No, she didn’t know I was coming.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120
She’s leaving now.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.720
I see.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.800
I didn’t want to miss
anything important.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.360
I was nearby,
so I dropped by to help out.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.000
May, we have to go.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.440
I have to go.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.320
I’ll stay and work here
while I wait for you.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.840
I don’t know what time
I’ll be done, Pat.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Don’t wait for me.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.480
I’ll leave too.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200
Let’s go together.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640
See you, Pat.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320
Okay.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320
Let's go.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880
Pat.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.600
Excuse me,
I can’t find a client’s information.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.040
I think there’s a backup
on a hard drive in May’s office.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.240
But I don’t want to go in.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.000
I’ll check it out for you.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.200
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.440
(Partnership Agreement)

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.480
(Komkrit Akaradechanont)

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960
Are you done?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.280
It was a successful pitch.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.520
Congratulations.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360
Thank you.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.960
I called to let you know
I’ll be home late.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.760
I’m taking the team out
to celebrate.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.160
Are you home, Pat?

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720
No.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.520
I'm at the office.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720
What? You're still there?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.480
I told you not to wait for me.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.560
Is something wrong?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
No.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Take care.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.120
Where are you guys going tonight?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.480
We’re at Krit’s bar.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.480
The team wanted to come here.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.480
Okay.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.880
I’ll wait for you at home.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240
Okay.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.320
You should've invited Pat
to come and celebrate.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.520
He doesn’t like places like this,
so I didn’t invite him.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800
It’ll just be like last time again.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.360
It’s good that you were honest
with him about coming here.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.080
Better than him finding out
on his own or from someone else.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.120
Don’t be stressed.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.360
You just signed a deal
with a new client.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.760
Like I said, if you want to get
something done your way,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.680
you definitely can.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.240
I believe
you’ll be able to do the same

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.440
with Pat.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.520
Go all out tonight. It’s on me.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.720
Pat.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.800
You still haven’t come home.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.440
I can’t let you have all the fun.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.040
Please sit down, Pat.
I’ll get you something to drink.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.720
Excuse me,
one glass of wine, please.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.680
I heard you made
a successful pitch today.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.160
Yes.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.400
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.200
- Cheers.
- It's fine, Pat.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200
I can drink.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200
Cheers.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.640
I said I'm fine.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.440
We'll get going then,
May, Pat, and Krit.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.080
- Let's go. Bye.
- Bye.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.720
By the way, May.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.440
I have a surprise for you.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840
Actually,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.560
I wanted to give this to you
on your birthday,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760
but I was too eager.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.560
Think of it

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.880
as a gift
for your successful pitch today.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600
Thank you, Pat.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720
Okay.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240
It's beautiful.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.920
I wanted to let you know

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.440
that I’m ready
to support you in everything.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.400
Every single thing you do.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.160
I’m so proud of you.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.960
I’ll always be here for you.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560
Thank you.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.360
You haven’t told me
you love me lately.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.600
Tell me.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.640
Come on, please tell me.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720
Okay.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.160
It’s okay if you don’t say it,

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.280
because I know you love me.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.160
Pat.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.960
I think you’ve had too much
to drink. Let’s go home.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.080
I’ll get going, Krit.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.840
Sure.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Krit.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.640
Thank you so much

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.800
for taking care of May
while I was away.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960
Let's go.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.000
- Come on.
- Bye.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.640
Pat, what's wrong?

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.320
Are you drunk?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920
No.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160
I'm not drunk.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.080
I only had a little to drink.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.040
I know what I’m doing.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.840
I’m fully conscious.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.560
Pat.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360
Why?

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.840
Am I not good enough?

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.640
Tell me what I need to improve on.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.640
I’ll do better for you.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.120
Just tell me.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680
Is there something

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.920
you’d like to tell me?

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.840
You’re keeping a secret from me,
aren’t you?

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760
Right?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.120
Tell me!

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.080
Tell me!

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.400
No, Pat. Let me go.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.840
Tell me now.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.640
- Pat.
- I said tell me.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.560
Talk to me.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720
Pat!

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.040
What's the matter with you?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.160
Go to sleep if you're drunk.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.840
Let me go, Pat.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.280
I love you.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.280
I love you.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.040
I want to have children with you.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.200
I want to start a family with you.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.920
Our wedding is coming up.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.600
I can’t wait
to have children with you.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.080
- Pat.
- May.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.120
May, please...

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.280
I love you so much.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.080
I love you.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160
(Emergency Contraceptive Tablet)

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.680
What's wrong with it?

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680
What's wrong?

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160
Huh?

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.600
It won't start.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.760
Let me try.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400
Well...

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.360
We have to call a mechanic.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600
How about this?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.680
Ride with me.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.960
We can go to the office together.
It will save on gas.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640
May.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640
I’m sorry about last night.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.560
I'm really sorry.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.560
Yes, Krit.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.640
How are you, May?

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.360
You didn’t answer my calls.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.920
Are you sick?

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.360
My car broke down.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.640
I just got to the office,
so I'm calling you back.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.200
I’m meeting my friend
tonight at the bar,

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.400
in case you wanted to make up
for leaving early last time.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.280
My friend wants to update us
on some new business ideas.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.360
Are you interested?

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.120
I can’t go tonight.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.680
Pat won’t let me take a taxi,
he’ll drive me there.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.720
Also, I don’t know

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.920
what to tell him
about you and your friend,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.320
because I didn’t tell him
we’re partners.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.160
You haven’t told him?

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.040
It might be time to tell him
you’re a partner at the bar.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.640
If he finds out on his own,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.200
he’ll be even more suspicious.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.240
I think

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.280
Pat’s already suspicious about us.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.600
Did you notice him
acting strange last night?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Really?

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.600
I think he was normal.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.400
But you know him better than I do.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.760
If you think
he’s starting to have doubts,

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.680
then maybe it’s time

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.560
for you

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.920
to tell him about us.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.920
If you keep this going,

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.920
it might get worse.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200
Krit.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.720
Let’s keep some distance
between us for now.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.640
Let me make sure
that Pat’s really okay.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.960
I also want some time alone
to figure out how I really feel.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.920
And about not joining
you and your friends tonight,

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.080
I hope you understand.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.960
I do.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.920
Of course I do.
I understand everything.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.680
If you’re stressed about something,

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.000
you can always call me.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.960
Okay, thank you.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.640
Excuse me.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.760
I’m returning the hard drive
I borrowed yesterday.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.560
Pat came in
and got it for me yesterday.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.080
Pat.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.040
I have something to tell you.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.520
I’m a partner at Krit’s bar.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.200
I haven’t had the chance
to tell you.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040
I know.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.880
I know that you know.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.600
You know that I know?

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400
Why are you only telling me now?

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.640
Well...

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.080
I was afraid you wouldn’t agree
with me about it,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.320
so I didn’t tell you.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.360
I’m sorry
for not telling you earlier.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.520
Is there anything else I don’t know?

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.760
Honestly, is there something
you’re still hiding from me?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.840
If you have secrets, tell me now
and I won’t get mad.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.000
Or if you think we don’t have
a future, just say it.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.160
You keep saying
you want to postpone the wedding.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.720
Is it because
you don’t want to get married?

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.880
If you want to break up
with me, just tell me.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920
Say it.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.480
I’m the one who should be crying.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.880
Krit.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.360
Is she really ignoring you?

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.760
She left early last time.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.840
She didn’t come today.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.200
Has she decided not to pick you?

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.960
Hey.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.320
Maybe you should stop scheming
to fleece her.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Find a new victim.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480
Help me.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120
With what?

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.880
(Krit)

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.080
It’s late.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200
Where are you going?

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.320
I...

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.840
I want to run some errands.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.480
May I borrow your car?

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.560
I’ll take you there.
Where are you going?

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160
It's okay.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600
Where are you going?

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600
Let's talk later.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.120
Krit.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.120
What happened? Let me see.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400
Well...

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.520
I got into a fight with my friend.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.280
Hit me harder.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.600
Make it real.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.000
Make her pity me so much

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.600
she leaves her boyfriend
and comes to me.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.440
- Hit me.
- Sure.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960
So?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.480
Like I said,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.920
my friend cheated me.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.960
I don’t have the cash
to pay him back,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.200
so he beat me up.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.200
Krit.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.480
You should get a lawyer and sue him.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.800
If you let this go,
he could hurt you even more.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.920
I have a lawyer friend.
I’ll handle it.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.960
May, let’s not make this a big deal.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.200
I’ll take care of it on my own.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.280
Thank you

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.160
for always rushing to see me
whenever I have a problem.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.480
It has made me realize

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.160
who

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.440
I want to spend
the rest of my life with,

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.920
who’s always been by my side

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.400
and makes me feel at ease.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320
That person...

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040
is you, May.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.080
I don’t want to rush you.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.160
But every time I see you,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.040
you seem uncomfortable.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.520
I can make you feel at peace.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200
Break up with Pat

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.480
and be with me.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.320
I’ll help you talk to him.
I’m sure he’ll understand.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240
I love you.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.920
We love each other.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.040
Don't waste time
with someone you don’t love.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.440
Pat.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.480
Pat.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.160
Pat.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880
Why?

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.440
You’re going to ask how I found out
you were here?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.280
"Don’t worry about me, May.
I just had a fight with my friend."

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120
Did I send it to you?

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.680
I was probably out of it
and sent it to the wrong person.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.880
I’m so sorry, May.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.280
What were you guys doing?

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200
Go ahead, carry on.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.120
Don’t worry, I know everything.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.240
Do whatever you want from now on.
There’s no need to hide.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.360
I’ll let you do whatever you want.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240
Go on.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.200
Why not?

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.560
The May I know

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.280
isn’t afraid to do anything.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Pat.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.200
Pat.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520
Go ahead.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.040
Krit.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.040
If you don’t mind, I don’t mind.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.240
Do you want to kiss her? Do it.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.360
If you can’t choose, stay like this,
the three of us together forever.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080
Are you up for it?

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.440
Don't do it, Krit.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.000
Stop, Pat.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.600
Pat, stop. Come here.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.480
Pat.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.720
Let's go home.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.040
Let her choose.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.520
Let her choose
who she wants to be with.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.440
Come home with me.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.200
- Pat.
- Why are you crying?

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920
Why are you crying?

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.640
Because I found out the truth,
or because I took you away from him?

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.520
How could you do this to me?

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.760
What did I do wrong?
All I ever did was love you.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.720
I'm sorry, Pat.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.080
I didn’t mean for it
to turn out this way.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.760
You didn’t mean to?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.960
You brought him into my house
and had sex right there.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.840
You said you were sick that day.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.000
I said I’d hurry home, but you told
me not to, because you cared.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.080
But that wasn’t true.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.880
You just wanted to invite him
over for sex.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400
I'm sorry.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.560
I didn’t think you’d come home.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.640
You didn’t think I’d come home?

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.280
If I didn’t come home,
you could go ahead and do it, right?

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800
You didn’t know?

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.160
I don’t know what’s wrong with me,

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680
or how I feel about anyone.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.360
But I didn’t want it
to turn out like this.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.600
All right. Don’t say anything else.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.240
Stop it, Pat! Stop it.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.480
Pat, let me see it.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.320
Enough.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.600
Stop pretending that you love
or care about me.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.880
Now I get it.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.640
You said we’re too different,
but that’s not true.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.720
You just have feelings
for someone else.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200
That's it.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.840
You stayed with me
because you felt sorry for me.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.760
May, no more.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.200
You don't have to change
for me anymore.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.880
May.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880
Let's break up.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.040
Let's end things here.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.320
When you meet a good person you
don’t love, don’t hold them back.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.480
Let them go find someone
who loves them more than you do.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.360
We wish you happiness, Sexy May.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.040
What are you doing here, Pat?

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.680
When you called me, it’s not that
I didn’t want to talk to you.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.720
But the more you do this,
the guiltier I feel. Don’t do this.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.240
The day you moved out
and Krit was waiting for you.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.040
He saw me,

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.680
and the look in his eyes
wasn’t trustworthy.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.760
Be careful.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.240
When you hold him like that,
you will lean...

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.360
It's like, go away!

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.480
Go away.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.040
You're so mean.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.320
- I'm not a cockroach.
- She hates it.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.800
I don't hate it.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.800
Kiss her.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.560
You can push him away.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.840
- Let's go home.
- Let's go home.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.800
I'm drunk.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.160
Then...

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160
Go ahead.
