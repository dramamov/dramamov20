=Episode 21=

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.620
That was how you tortured her yesterday.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.100
You have sympathy for her.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.300
As commander of the guards,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.499
you used such despicable methods
to frame the Empress.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.300
She is the fox demon.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.140
I assumed it was foolproof.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.779
But I didn't expect you two
to be working together.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.500
I was careless.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.900
Huang Gou'er,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.060
I never imagined

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.700
you could be so cruel.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Now, the only way to lessen your guilt

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.499
is to confess what you know.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900
My guilt?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.780
Your Lordship's guilt
runs deeper than mine.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.459
You personally killed
all those living beings.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.060
Your methods
are far more cruel than mine.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.380
Do you know I was poisoned with Gu?

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.900
No.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.900
All right.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.620
I'll make you talk.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.660
You're familiar with this, aren't you?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.100
The Soul-Piercing Needle.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.739
You often use it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.700
to torment prisoners.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.740
It's said

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.539
that inserting it two inches
into the ear

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899
brings pain like
thousands of ants gnawing.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.700
At four inches,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.540
it's like a thousand arrows
piercing the heart.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.500
Seven inches causes pain

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.019
like a dull knife scraping the heart,
lungs, muscles,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.940
and skin being peeled off.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.100
Today,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.700
I'd like to test if these rumors

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.140
are true on you.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.060
I'll ask again.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.900
Do you know I was poisoned with Gu?

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.780
Answer me!

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.779
I'll talk!

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.859
I know, I know...

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.500
What Gu was I poisoned with?

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.259
I...

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.580
I don't know...

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.859
Is that so?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.660
It's the Mother-Child Gu!

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.780
You're finally telling the truth.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.340
Who poisoned me?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.619
Me.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.179
I did it.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.059
How?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.419
When?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.899
When you were a child,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.259
His Majesty often
sent you glutinous rice cakes.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.380
That's where I put the Gu.

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:15.340
When I was a child?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.900
You were also only a child then.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.700
How could you have learned
how to cast Gu poisons?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.980
Speak.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.900
Who told you to do it?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300
Want to bite your tongue?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.819
I see you're a loyal dog.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.540
It was all me.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.939
Just kill me...

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.260
Want to die?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.300
Not so easy.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.260
Soon enough,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.580
I'll make you talk.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.700
Your Majesty,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.340
your suspicions were correct.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.700
It seems the Frozen Curse
on Xiling Xuan's heart has been lifted.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.780
He's remembered everything.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.940
It appears the fox demon he killed

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.700
was from the fox clan on Mount Yao.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.219
They must have known each other,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.860
and now they're seeking revenge
on the mastermind controlling the Gu.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.100
If that's the case...

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.060
Help me with one last thing.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.820
Yaya, trust me.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.900
Xiling Heng is the one behind this.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.900
I was young,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.980
but I trust

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.779
that he never would have
done that to me.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.300
It must have been someone else.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.059
Your Highness.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.979
Your Lordship.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.059
Huang Gou'er is dead.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.300
What?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.779
How did he die?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.979
Just now.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.939
His Majesty declared

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.979
that Huang Gou'er,
guilty of framing the Empress

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.979
and practicing sorcery
inside the palace,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.340
deserved death,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.700
and executed him in prison.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.900
Just as I expected.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.179
He killed Huang Gou'er to prevent him

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.740
from revealing any more information.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.379
The mastermind must be him.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.900
The Mother Gu is in his possession.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.379
Xiling Heng might return soon.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.900
We must act quickly.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.860
This is a portrait
of the Former Empress.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.900
I feel like
I've seen her somewhere before...

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.380
The Mother Gu.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.180
Yaya, I think I've found the Mother Gu.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.780
Yaya.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.700
I killed the Mother Gu.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.140
Yaya!

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.260
Yaya?

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.500
Huang Gou'er?

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.500
You're alive.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.660
The thing you're looking for is here.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.780
So this was your trap.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.100
Xiling Heng,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.180
it really was you
controlling the Mother Gu.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.779
How does it feel

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.500
to have your entire clan
slaughtered by your beloved?

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.220
He was so happy

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.220
killing your whole clan,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.139
hopping around like a bird.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.619
Enough of this!

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.700
This is all because
you're controlling him!

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.499
Once Yaya regains his senses,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.259
he will never forgive you!

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.579
Fret not.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.300
From this day forward,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.100
he will never wake up again.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.380
Yaya...

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.220
I'll kill you!

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.699
You demon,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.339
how dare you

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.460
trespass my bedchamber at night
with a weapon!

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.179
Not only have you
killed palace attendants,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.820
but you also tried to assassinate me.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.899
Fortunately,
Lord Wing came to the rescue

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.660
and captured you.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.739
Yaya...

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.299
Tomorrow morning,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.099
I will

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.699
have you executed

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.820
before all the ministers.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.580
Ministers.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.820
Last night,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.260
I finally caught the wicked demon
lurking by my side.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.499
Thanks to the cooperation

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.980
of Lord Wing and Commander Huang,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.539
this wicked demon was captured

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.500
while attempting to assassinate me.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.699
Humans and demons

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.299
cannot coexist.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.539
That's right! They cannot!

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.940
Now,

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.700
in front of all ministers present,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.939
I will burn her alive!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.379
Burn her! Burn her!

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.419
Burn her! Burn her!

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.379
Yaya...

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.539
Burn her! Burn her!

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.459
Come to your senses...

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.299
Burn her! Burn her!

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.299
Yaya...

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.820
Burn her! Burn her!

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.300
Fox demon.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.100
Your time

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.260
has come.
