(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.840
This is our old apartment.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.320
(Sorry, we didn't find any pages
related to "Chen Jia Wen")

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880
Hello,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
Ms. Wang.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
Shen Meng!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.800
How many times
have you been late already?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760
Do you still want this job or not?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.840
We're back again.

("Ex" Series Director,
Tian Yu Sheng)

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400
Hey, Zhao.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560
What's up?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080
Who am I?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
What's my job?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
Are you crazy?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160
I'm in a meeting. I have to go.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.720
Zhao, make me a cup of coffee.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.520
Shen Meng.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200
Why are you looking at me?

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.800
Hurry and retouch your makeup.
We're going live soon.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.760
Hello, sir.
What would you like to drink?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.480
We have some vintage whiskey here.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.960
Water, please.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080
Okay.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.480
Why are you grinding
coffee beans now?

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.480
Didn't you always
buy instant coffee?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720
It relieves stress.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.639
When I grind coffee, I feel like...

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.880
I can totally calm down.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.040
It's the same when you play games.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.280
I haven't played games
in a long time.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880
I didn't have the time.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280
Let me do it.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920
What do you want to eat later?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
Let's have porridge.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.960
My stomach isn't so well now.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.760
Just add a sea cucumber.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.480
Wake up.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040
We're back.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.600
That's so exquisite.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.720
Do you think
you're still Director Chen?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.800
Why are we back again?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.920
It's your fault.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.000
You insisted on drinking.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120
Why drink?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.640
Didn't you enjoy drinking?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.600
So what should we do next?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.480
Let's calm down first.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.680
Hello, welcome.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Are you here to buy a bike?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520
I'm just looking around.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.360
Why are you suddenly riding a bike?

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.320
I've been doing it for two years.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.320
You like this one?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.920
This was what I used to ride.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.960
You know a lot about bikes.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320
You're tired already?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760
You are...

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360
so amazing now.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.880
The wind feels so nice tonight.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.880
However,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.520
I think something's still missing.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.560
Now, you like this too?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520
Thank you.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.640
I couldn't even imagine...

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120
this scene before.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.520
It's strange, actually.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.760
When we were together,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.920
we grew more and more distant.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.079
But after being apart
for four years,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.600
we became more and more alike.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.080
Why did we break up?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680
I don't remember anymore.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.960
I just remember
we fought a lot back then.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.280
Maybe it got too intense one time,
so we broke up.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.400
I feel like those things...

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160
wouldn't even cause a fight now.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040
What's the matter?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400
Do you regret it?

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040
Who says so?

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.360
I'm just feeling sentimental.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600
I regret it a bit.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
You took it seriously?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440
I was just kidding.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920
- Actually...
- Actually...

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640
- You go first.
- You go first.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440
- Then I'll...
- I'll go first.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.520
I'll say it.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.760
I want to tell you this seriously.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.600
Actually, in the past four years,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040
I've always...
