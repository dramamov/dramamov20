00:00:01.505 --> 00:00:06.305
The systolic blood pressure
is 82 millimeters of mercury.

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:11.185
The diastolic blood pressure
is 55 millimeters of mercury.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:16.305
Heart rate is 75 beats per minute.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:20.665
This isn't good.

00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:23.785
You need to stay in the hospital.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.545
I already talked to them.
They told me I can just stay home.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:30.265
Which doctor?

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.065
I've never seen
a doctor's name on your pill bag.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:37.705
You never let me or Non
accompany you to the hospital.

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.425
Do I have to ask your doctor
what's wrong myself?

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:44.985
Mom!

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.425
I'll talk to him again.

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:52.905
Him who? Give me his name.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.745
There's many of them, I can't remember.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.385
They take good care of me.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:02.105
If a public hospital is such a hassle,
then don't go.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:04.385
I'll go ask San for help.

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:06.265
No!

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:10.945
He can and he wants to help!
His family owns the hospital.

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:12.105
There's no need.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:13.825
No, Mom!

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.345
You need to get checked properly
so you can get treatment on time.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:19.665
Am I not being clear?

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:23.745
Leave him alone.

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:36.265
Don't bother him.

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:40.665
Everyone faces their own consequences.

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:42.425
I'll take care of myself.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:49.505
Do you realize you've been
talking about karma a lot lately?

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:53.265
Be honest, did you know what it was?

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:55.865
Can you tell me?

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.185
-I'm not that sick.
-Is it cancer?

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:02.545
-What stage is it?
-It's not cancer.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.305
Then what the hell is it?

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:08.744
I can't take it anymore!

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.545
You don't give me any choice!

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:16.385
You don't make any decisions!

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:19.745
What exactly do you want?

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:31.505
Let me ask you.

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:34.905
Do you actually want to be cured?

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:46.865
Here's your porridge.

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:49.185
Want to eat it now?

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.305
She will eat now and take her medicines.

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:54.225
Put it in a bowl for me.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:16.745
Ning.

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:19.185
I gotta go to the lab for work.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.465
Here's your porridge.

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:54.545
Thank you.

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:08.105
Mom…

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:14.385
When I was little,
I never ate by myself, did I?

00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:17.665
Mmm.

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:21.585
That's right.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:26.665
You were around five or six
before you could eat by yourself.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:29.665
Before that, I had to feed you.

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:31.705
You let no one else feed you.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:33.905
Why was that?

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:36.225
Exactly.

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:37.985
Why was that, hmm?

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.065
Let's have one big spoon.

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:07.185
To anyone who gets this video,

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:12.745
be careful using my confession as proof.

00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:16.905
It could end up hurting you

00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.545
or someone you care about.

00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:24.505
Everything I'm going to say
from now on is true.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:30.425
All of this began with a project
called Anisong.

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:35.705
YEAR 2002

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:45.145
I can't take it!

00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:52.825
Everyone is ready to share responsibility.
Why should you bear this alone?

00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:56.345
I don't know.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.105
Hamilton's rules.

00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:11.105
I'll leave it to you now.

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:16.105
This is not funny.

00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:20.825
Can we have a moment, please?

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:22.465
Yes.

00:08:31.185 --> 00:08:32.664
We've talked about this.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:37.745
Everyone thinks you got fired!
Not that you're going to jail!

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:40.784
-They won't be okay if they find out.
-Not okay and then what?

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:46.625
Does anyone go to jail to look cool?

00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:49.625
Should we ruin our future just like that?

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:53.905
Not everyone is lucky
to have a house or land.

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:58.225
This job might be
the only thing they have.

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:01.505
And what about your life?

00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:03.025
Your kids?

00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:07.705
These people aren't your family
or relatives, not even close.

00:09:08.425 --> 00:09:09.585
Who said that?

00:09:16.905 --> 00:09:19.265
Don't act like you know more than me.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:22.505
I know what I'm doing.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.825
Everyone else needs to know this.

00:09:27.825 --> 00:09:29.625
-Let's see what they say.
-Wiroj!

00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:32.425
Dang had a picture.

00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:40.065
A picture?

00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:43.305
What picture?

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:46.385
Us in the car.

00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:48.625
How is that possible?

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:53.345
They all know about our relationship.

00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:56.745
People in this place?

00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:04.385
Forget it.

00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:10.185
Yeah, forget it! We are two grown adults.

00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:14.825
So they brought up corruption.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:19.585
And we really did that.
We really forged the receipt.

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:27.065
If we fight this,
they'll use our picture against us.

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:29.305
What will you do next?

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.185
What about your wife? Your parents?

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:38.625
I will say this one last time.

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:43.705
These people can decide
whether we live or die.

00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:52.865
And your future matters to me.

00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:56.345
Because I know people like you

00:10:57.305 --> 00:10:59.625
will be able to change a lot of things.

00:11:01.305 --> 00:11:02.985
But not people like me.

00:11:04.985 --> 00:11:06.785
You know what to do.

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:15.585
I'll go now.

00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:17.625
Good luck.

00:11:24.665 --> 00:11:27.505
She was accused of corruption
by the new management,

00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:30.585
wanting to take over the research
department's budget.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:36.585
Because of that decision,
our relationship came to an end.

00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:41.585
But things weren't as simple
as she thought.

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:49.785
In the end,
she couldn't let herself go to jail…

00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:01.185
because she had just found out
she was pregnant with her second child.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.385
So she chose to flee the country,

00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:10.705
wait until everything is over
to come back…

00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:13.865
and it was the right call.

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:16.545
Three years later,

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:19.225
no one bothered to track her down
and punish her,

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.465
not even those who accused her.

00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:23.625
They'd done well for themselves.

00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:24.745
Ning.

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:27.865
I missed you so much.

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:30.305
Where is my little brother?

00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:36.825
Non!

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:41.945
Come on. Non.

00:12:42.545 --> 00:12:44.065
Come see your sister.

00:12:48.385 --> 00:12:50.665
Non, this is Ning.

00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:52.825
You two are siblings.

00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:06.945
After that, she started her new life.

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:09.225
She did labor work

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:11.705
just to look after her kids.

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:13.505
Here you go.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.745
Because there was no way
she could work as a scientist.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.225
She had to hide her past.

00:13:20.305 --> 00:13:22.345
Salmon steak, fried squid and for drinks?

00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:24.665
Especially with her kids.

00:13:24.745 --> 00:13:30.505
There are four types of jellyfish.
Freshwater jellyfish is hydrozoa class.

00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:36.505
The next one is in the class of Scyphozoa.

00:13:37.745 --> 00:13:40.785
But she knows that she is the reason

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:45.225
why her kids can't have a perfect life
even though it was supposed to be better.

00:13:45.545 --> 00:13:47.545
Four jellyfish.

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:49.185
Mom.

00:13:49.865 --> 00:13:51.185
Mmm-hmm.

00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:54.025
What's wrong?

00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:56.465
No, nothing.

00:13:56.985 --> 00:14:00.305
My head's spinning
from the things you said.

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:02.785
All of these are scientific names.

00:14:04.065 --> 00:14:06.225
How can you remember all of it?

00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:08.825
-I can't actually.
-Huh?

00:14:08.905 --> 00:14:10.385
Just kidding.

00:14:10.465 --> 00:14:11.585
I don't know.

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:14.185
Maybe I read it often,
so I memorized it naturally.

00:14:15.025 --> 00:14:18.585
I think you can remember it
because you like it.

00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:23.465
Hmm, that's actually true.

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:27.585
But lately,
it's like I need to memorize it.

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:30.465
Otherwise, I can't do well on my exam.

00:14:30.545 --> 00:14:33.665
I have to speak it out loud,
making it stick in my brain.

00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:37.825
Try to memorize as much as you can now.

00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:42.025
One day, you'll only remember…

00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:46.465
what you want to remember…

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:49.625
without anyone forcing you to.

00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:55.105
Huh. What a quote.

00:15:03.065 --> 00:15:04.145
Non.

00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:06.425
Go open the door.

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:20.225
Go open the door.

00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:22.705
Why don't you just ask Ning?

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:24.665
I'm busy.

00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:26.465
I'm busy, too.

00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:28.825
I'm preparing for my exam.

00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:35.465
Make me do every damn thing.

00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:37.505
Mom, Non used swear words.

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:42.985
He also hasn't gotten a haircut,
and that breaks school rules.

00:15:58.865 --> 00:16:00.985
Ning! The Patron's scholarship!

00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:04.985
Let's see.

00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:20.545
What is it?

00:16:23.425 --> 00:16:25.825
Nothing, I can study at another place.

00:16:25.945 --> 00:16:27.065
Let's me see.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.985
The submitted documents are incomplete?

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:40.225
We already sent them everything.
What more do they want?

00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:45.225
Never mind, Mom. We don't have to pretend
to be poorer to get their money.

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:48.185
Someone else might need it more than I do.

00:16:49.145 --> 00:16:51.665
No. I don't think this is normal.

00:16:54.865 --> 00:16:56.745
You know what's normal?

00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:18.385
Hello, what can I get you?

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.025
Hey! Phao!

00:17:22.704 --> 00:17:24.464
How have you been, Professor?

00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:26.745
Oh, my God!

00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:29.625
I live around here, and I'm still alive.

00:17:29.705 --> 00:17:31.985
When was the last time we saw each other?

00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:34.465
Oh! I think it's been almost 15 years.

00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:37.105
You are still as gorgeous.

00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:42.425
Let's get drinks! But I can't drink here,
I'll get yelled at.

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:43.825
Give me your number.

00:17:47.465 --> 00:17:48.425
Kanchana…

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:52.505
my boss wants to meet you.

00:17:54.505 --> 00:17:56.105
He's got a job offer for you.

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:00.905
What kind of job?

00:18:02.305 --> 00:18:04.105
Are you available after work?

00:18:05.345 --> 00:18:07.305
He's here in the van at the back.

00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:09.745
He said he can wait.

00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:12.825
He?

00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:18.905
Be honest with me. Who is your boss?

00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:07.385
Dr. Kanchana,
I am glad to talk to you again.

00:19:07.945 --> 00:19:09.465
Hello, sir.

00:19:10.145 --> 00:19:12.465
I am about to start a project.

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:17.945
It means a lot to my family.
I'd like you to be the one in charge.

00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:23.665
Yes, sir.

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.145
This project is called Anisong.

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:31.185
It's a scientific research project
that has never been done before.

00:19:31.265 --> 00:19:32.345
Wait, sir.

00:19:33.585 --> 00:19:34.705
I have a question.

00:19:34.785 --> 00:19:37.545
About the compensation?
Just name your price.

00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:39.105
No, it's not about that.

00:19:39.185 --> 00:19:42.345
But Ning and Non are supposed
to have a better life.

00:19:42.985 --> 00:19:44.265
Especially, Ning.

00:19:44.345 --> 00:19:48.025
Was Ning's scholarship turned down
because of this offer?

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.545
Kanchana, everything is related.

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:53.945
Both intentionally and unintentionally.

00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:58.905
If you're interested, take the phone.

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:02.745
But if not, then leave it here.

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:10.425
The researcher he is looking for
is not only the best

00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:16.705
but also willing to protect this secret
unconditionally for life.

00:20:16.785 --> 00:20:20.945
Moreover, you won't get any recognition
or status from this project…

00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:25.305
but the reward is massive.

00:20:25.385 --> 00:20:27.985
Enough for your children
and grandchildren for life.

00:20:28.585 --> 00:20:33.025
Who suits this position best
if not Dr. Kanchana?

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:41.665
Ning.

00:20:42.425 --> 00:20:43.425
Jean.

00:20:44.305 --> 00:20:45.905
I can't take this anymore.

00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:49.545
-I don't want to watch it anymore.
-Calm down.

00:20:51.345 --> 00:20:53.545
I have no idea who my mom is.

00:20:55.385 --> 00:20:57.625
I thought that she is my mom…

00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:02.025
but how could she lie to me
this entire time?

00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:04.065
Ning, take it easy.

00:21:09.425 --> 00:21:12.305
You need to calm down first, Ning.

00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:16.345
Listen…

00:21:17.585 --> 00:21:21.305
we have to figure out
what the Anisong project is.

00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:24.625
Check this out.

00:21:25.625 --> 00:21:27.545
Is this your mom's hand writing?

00:21:28.185 --> 00:21:30.225
Yeah. What is this?

00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:35.225
This is the preservation
of human cells after death.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.585
Preservation?

00:21:40.505 --> 00:21:41.665
Why?

00:21:43.905 --> 00:21:44.985
I have no idea.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:51.305
But I think this is
way beyond what we imagined.

00:21:57.105 --> 00:21:58.785
I understand you.

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:04.745
But I think we need
to keep watching Wiroj's video.

00:22:11.545 --> 00:22:14.665
In the end, we will die, including him.

00:22:15.225 --> 00:22:16.545
He believes that.

00:22:17.585 --> 00:22:21.785
He doesn't believe in immortality
or elixirs of life…

00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:26.305
because it will make him an outcast

00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:28.945
in a society that believes
in reincarnation.

00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:35.145
But what if his body doesn't decay
even though he's already dead?

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:38.505
It will backfire terribly.

00:22:40.145 --> 00:22:41.745
You mean like a holy monk?

00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:45.905
No, not like a holy monk.

00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:47.865
But what I'm talking about is…

00:22:48.985 --> 00:22:53.545
the cells of a dead person that don't
decompose, according to real science.

00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:57.025
What is that for?

00:22:57.105 --> 00:23:00.465
Just imagine, out of 75,000 villages,

00:23:01.265 --> 00:23:03.585
how many of them worship him as a god?

00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:07.545
That's the reward for his good deeds.

00:23:08.265 --> 00:23:10.905
If he hadn't done so much CSR,

00:23:10.985 --> 00:23:13.865
Kiatpipat would fall apart
in his father's days.

00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:17.625
A body that does not decay,

00:23:17.705 --> 00:23:20.985
combined with the faith
the entire nation has in him…

00:23:22.185 --> 00:23:26.705
Just think.
What kind of result would that produce?

00:23:29.945 --> 00:23:33.905
And what if the Anisong serum
were injected into the heirs

00:23:33.985 --> 00:23:36.305
of Kiatpipat every generation from now,

00:23:36.905 --> 00:23:40.785
and if science could also prove

00:23:40.865 --> 00:23:44.745
that the process occurs
only in their family cells…

00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:48.665
What do you think
other people will think of them?

00:23:54.865 --> 00:23:56.705
Are you insane? Huh?

00:23:57.665 --> 00:23:59.545
How could you be crazier than him?

00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.105
That's true.

00:24:04.785 --> 00:24:09.025
But if you think about the concept,
it doesn't hurt anyone, does it?

00:24:10.665 --> 00:24:13.185
And it could really happen.

00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:16.185
What is not real is…

00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:22.225
Who says faith can't be inherited
through blood?

00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:27.025
That's the goal of the Anisong project
created by the Patron.

00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:31.825
As we all know,
he's like a saint to all of us.

00:24:34.665 --> 00:24:37.585
The faith and authority
he has cultivated for over 50 years

00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:42.105
have driven Kiatpipat's
business empire to grow beyond control.

00:24:45.505 --> 00:24:48.705
Good job.
Let's work together once you've graduated.

00:24:48.785 --> 00:24:53.465
The Official Ranking of Thailand's
50 Wealthiest Individuals in 2023.

00:24:53.545 --> 00:24:57.545
The combined wealth of all 50 individuals
has increased by nearly 15%,

00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:00.985
which amounts to approximately
170 billion US dollars.

00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:04.065
And number one is Mr. Phumtham Kiatpipat.

00:25:04.145 --> 00:25:06.745
But the Patron knows
that faith and authority

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:09.225
are not legacy that can be passed down.

00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:10.785
Cheers!.

00:25:10.865 --> 00:25:16.225
Soon, he'll have to pass it on to Joe,
his only son.

00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:20.625
You're drunk now.

00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:23.025
Bottle up!

00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:36.865
Give them whatever amount they ask for.

00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:39.265
-But this must stay a secret.
-Yes, sir.

00:25:44.785 --> 00:25:47.905
He has no desire to overcome death.

00:25:47.985 --> 00:25:53.865
But he thought of developing a drug
that can preserve his body after death.

00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:56.105
If he can make it happen,

00:25:56.865 --> 00:26:00.865
every generation of his descendants
must go through the same process.

00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:04.985
Scientific proof will serve as evidence
that this is not mere superstition.

00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:06.865
They'll become extraordinary.

00:26:06.945 --> 00:26:10.665
All thanks to the good deeds
his family has done.

00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:16.225
When time passes,

00:26:16.985 --> 00:26:20.025
this story will elevate them
to a sacred status

00:26:20.105 --> 00:26:22.545
inherited through their bloodline.

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:27.105
They won't rely on fading faith or power
when the Patron leaves this world.

00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:36.025
And the most important thing is

00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:41.025
he needn't worry
that his heir will lack ability,

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:45.265
endangering a century-old family legacy.

00:26:45.785 --> 00:26:49.745
Dr. Kanchana's Anisong serum
would have been fully developed

00:26:50.305 --> 00:26:52.385
if that incident hadn't happened
that night.

00:26:55.745 --> 00:26:59.185
That was the night Dr. Aom,
a member of the research team,

00:26:59.265 --> 00:27:01.385
chose to spend the night
in the laboratory.

00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:08.665
Whoa!

00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:13.545
Whoa!

00:27:14.825 --> 00:27:16.865
I'll be the first one to do it.

00:27:21.425 --> 00:27:22.505
Joe.

00:27:23.785 --> 00:27:25.305
You can't be here.

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.065
Where are you going?

00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:46.185
Back off.

00:28:02.865 --> 00:28:04.945
Joe. Joe!

00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:06.265
Joe!

00:28:41.985 --> 00:28:43.545
What did you inject me with?

00:28:45.145 --> 00:28:47.185
I said, what did you inject me with?

00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:49.545
Bitch!

00:28:54.985 --> 00:28:56.225
Say it!

00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:57.425
Say it!

00:28:59.545 --> 00:29:01.225
What's in that injection?

00:29:05.745 --> 00:29:07.865
Damn it! Damn it!

00:29:09.305 --> 00:29:11.065
Damn it!

00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:25.345
At that time no one knew
what Dr. Aom injected Joe with…

00:29:25.425 --> 00:29:26.825
-San!
-Mom.

00:29:26.905 --> 00:29:29.345
By the time Dr. Kanchana
learned the entire story,

00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:33.385
she realized that the Anisong serum
was still incomplete.

00:29:33.825 --> 00:29:35.465
What are you doing?

00:29:37.825 --> 00:29:38.785
Joe.

00:29:39.105 --> 00:29:40.345
Later on,

00:29:40.425 --> 00:29:42.825
Joe still wasn't showing
any unusual symptoms.

00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:44.625
Let go of me!

00:29:44.705 --> 00:29:46.585
Let me go!

00:29:46.705 --> 00:29:48.985
He is being quarantined
in an isolation room

00:29:49.065 --> 00:29:52.345
with a team of doctors
monitoring him around the clock.

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:55.705
Joe's friends were silenced…

00:29:57.065 --> 00:30:00.345
because they were also accomplices
in the murder.

00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:05.585
As for Dr. Aom…

00:30:07.465 --> 00:30:12.105
just a brilliant orphan
who disappeared without a trace.

00:30:21.665 --> 00:30:24.745
He asked Dr. Kanchana
to suspend the Anisong Project,

00:30:24.825 --> 00:30:26.785
and ordered her to create a cure.

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.145
Because she knows this serum best.

00:30:31.905 --> 00:30:35.065
But Dr. Kanchana couldn't accept
what happened to Dr. Aom,

00:30:35.145 --> 00:30:37.945
and she couldn't withdraw
from the project either.

00:30:38.025 --> 00:30:39.785
So she negotiated with the Patron.

00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:44.585
She injected the same Anisong serum
that Joe had into her own body.

00:30:44.665 --> 00:30:49.105
She did that to make sure
that he would never harm her children.

00:30:51.945 --> 00:30:53.745
Over the following months,

00:30:54.905 --> 00:30:58.265
Dr. Kanchana devoted all her time
to developing the cure…

00:30:59.545 --> 00:31:01.545
with her own life at stake.

00:31:02.745 --> 00:31:05.625
But her body, along with Joe's,
was steadily falling apart.

00:31:06.385 --> 00:31:09.865
Due to the imperfections of the
Anisong serum circulating in her body…

00:31:12.465 --> 00:31:15.705
Dr. Kanchana was certain
she might not have enough time.

00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:23.785
She asked the Patron to entrust
the development of the cure to me

00:31:24.265 --> 00:31:25.505
because she believed

00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:28.945
I was the only one who could
continue her work.

00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:32.745
Wiroj?

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:35.625
Why does it have to be him?

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:55.665
NONNTAKAN JULY 8, 2003

00:31:55.745 --> 00:31:59.065
If you were me,
you probably wouldn't say it either.

00:32:02.585 --> 00:32:03.585
Well…

00:32:04.865 --> 00:32:05.865
It's like…

00:32:07.065 --> 00:32:08.505
there's nothing to say.

00:32:11.505 --> 00:32:13.465
How could anyone talk about this?

00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:22.185
You are so damn selfish.

00:32:23.945 --> 00:32:25.185
That's right.

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:28.305
How could you do this to me?

00:32:29.985 --> 00:32:31.505
Not only me…

00:32:31.585 --> 00:32:34.785
How could you do that to you kids?
Are you out of your mind?

00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:43.985
All right, then.

00:32:47.785 --> 00:32:51.345
I hope that this will be the one thing
that I do it right.

00:33:09.545 --> 00:33:10.625
This here…

00:33:11.905 --> 00:33:15.385
is the information
that I can bring outside.

00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:18.185
But not the whole thing.

00:33:18.265 --> 00:33:22.465
But I think this is enough
for you to take it further.

00:33:28.145 --> 00:33:30.025
You're using Non to force me into this.

00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:33.745
Yeah.

00:33:36.865 --> 00:33:40.025
It's not that I want to
leave this task to you…

00:33:43.825 --> 00:33:45.425
but I'm leaving my kids.

00:33:46.385 --> 00:33:48.505
Please take care of my babies.

00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:52.825
Listen to me, Wiroj.

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:55.825
You don't have to make this task succeed.

00:33:55.905 --> 00:33:59.305
Just don't make him feel
that you're no longer useful.

00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:01.505
That's all I ask.

00:34:01.585 --> 00:34:03.665
But if it ever reaches a dead end…

00:34:05.185 --> 00:34:07.065
I want you to let it go.

00:34:09.025 --> 00:34:13.784
Let this whole damn thing
die with me and with his son.

00:34:21.784 --> 00:34:24.264
You know exactly what to do.

00:34:33.425 --> 00:34:37.185
I brought Dr. Kanchana's eldest daughter
to assist with the research,

00:34:37.264 --> 00:34:39.585
only letting her know
a fraction of the truth.

00:34:39.985 --> 00:34:42.784
It's about her mother
and the Patron's incurable son.

00:34:44.385 --> 00:34:48.705
All this was to keep Dr. Kanchana's body
out of the public health system…

00:34:51.025 --> 00:34:54.824
and to keep this secret
under Kiatpipat's control

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:59.185
by making Ning the Patron's
sponsored protégé.

00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:10.985
Three months ago,

00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:14.225
I was forced to remove Ning
from the research.

00:35:15.585 --> 00:35:19.705
And I discovered that the properties
of the immortal jellyfish

00:35:20.265 --> 00:35:23.065
were the key to perfecting this cure.

00:35:24.225 --> 00:35:27.665
It will reprogram
the abnormal metabolic functions

00:35:27.745 --> 00:35:30.585
in the bodies of Dr. Kanchana and Joe.

00:35:31.705 --> 00:35:34.465
But because of the animal rights groups

00:35:34.545 --> 00:35:38.305
and the new regulations regarding
experimental substances,

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:40.785
my entire research process was delayed.

00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:43.065
I have no time left.

00:35:44.145 --> 00:35:49.585
I need to recruit a vulnerable group
at the university to test this serum.

00:35:50.385 --> 00:35:53.145
Before knowing about the report
on the parasite infection

00:35:53.225 --> 00:35:54.745
in the immortal jellyfish,

00:35:54.825 --> 00:35:56.585
which was known in a small circle…

00:35:57.545 --> 00:35:58.865
And I also discovered…

00:36:00.185 --> 00:36:01.465
that the parasite…

00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:05.025
had already been transmitted

00:36:05.105 --> 00:36:07.585
to the bodies of all the subjects
I had recruited.

00:36:08.305 --> 00:36:10.945
And I don't know the worst-case scenario,

00:36:11.025 --> 00:36:15.385
but from everything that has happened,
all the mistakes that occurred,

00:36:15.905 --> 00:36:17.465
I alone am responsible.

00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:21.745
Ning has nothing to do with it.

00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:30.625
What I can confirm is that
the cells of the immortal jellyfish

00:36:30.705 --> 00:36:33.305
is the key to make this serum perfect.

00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:34.905
And right now,

00:36:35.785 --> 00:36:39.425
I have already screened the uninfected
jellyfish and separated them.

00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:49.745
Everything I've said is true.

00:36:51.105 --> 00:36:53.225
Whoever gets this thumb drive,

00:36:53.865 --> 00:36:57.625
I'm praying you've got enough power
to get to the root of it.

00:36:59.025 --> 00:37:01.345
Because the main character in this story…

00:37:02.545 --> 00:37:04.665
He's definitely more influential than you.

00:37:05.905 --> 00:37:07.105
And the last thing…

00:37:08.305 --> 00:37:09.505
I'll say it again.

00:37:11.385 --> 00:37:13.185
Ning knows nothing about this.

00:37:14.185 --> 00:37:16.145
I alone take full responsibility.

00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:27.905
Pao was right.

00:37:29.305 --> 00:37:32.385
We should all just become zombies
and end everything.

00:37:41.665 --> 00:37:42.785
No.

00:37:44.465 --> 00:37:45.905
I won't let Thi do it.

00:37:46.505 --> 00:37:49.625
Send him instead.
And let Thi stay with us.

00:37:50.345 --> 00:37:53.105
I'm ready, though. I can do it.

00:37:54.425 --> 00:37:56.825
No, I don't trust you.

00:37:59.145 --> 00:38:00.505
Then send Non instead.

00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:02.585
Thorn.

00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:03.865
You shut up.

00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:06.225
-You're not going anywhere.
-Thorn.

00:38:06.305 --> 00:38:08.665
The decoy hardly needs to do anything.

00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:11.545
If we fail, we're in big trouble.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:13.385
He's an athlete.

00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:15.145
He should be with us.

00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:20.385
What's next?

00:38:21.025 --> 00:38:22.145
That's not true.

00:38:24.785 --> 00:38:26.025
Bullshit.

00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:30.465
What did you say?

00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:34.185
Nothing.

00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:36.305
No, nothing.

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.585
-Son of a bitch!
-Hey!

00:39:03.665 --> 00:39:05.225
Say it again!

00:39:05.305 --> 00:39:07.385
-Hey, San!
-Say it!

00:39:08.185 --> 00:39:10.465
-Say it!
-You want me to say it?

00:39:10.585 --> 00:39:12.345
You want me to say
why you didn't let Nonn go?

00:39:12.465 --> 00:39:13.545
Enough!

00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:15.625
If it's hard to choose, draw a name.

00:39:15.705 --> 00:39:16.705
Let's do that!

00:39:16.785 --> 00:39:19.385
Why would we do that?
This is life or death.

00:39:22.745 --> 00:39:23.785
Yeah.

00:39:25.305 --> 00:39:26.465
You're right.

00:39:31.545 --> 00:39:35.185
But no one gave you the right
to decide life or death for us, San.

00:39:35.265 --> 00:39:37.025
I've been confused for a while.

00:39:37.545 --> 00:39:39.985
What made you our team leader?

00:39:43.105 --> 00:39:44.625
Aren't you guys confused?

00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:53.305
Do you have something we don't?

00:39:58.865 --> 00:39:59.985
A gun?

00:40:01.105 --> 00:40:02.225
A brain?

00:40:03.305 --> 00:40:05.025
Look at you.

00:40:08.825 --> 00:40:10.945
Ready to make decisions for others.

00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:17.025
Just in case… Just in case…

00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:19.545
What if we frisk you right now?

00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:22.785
Would we find any medicines?

00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:29.665
Prao.

00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:35.145
If you say one more word, I'll kill you.

00:41:00.385 --> 00:41:02.545
So, shall we choose the real leader?

00:41:03.665 --> 00:41:05.345
The one that we all agreed on.

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:09.945
The one we won't be cursing later
even if they gets us killed.

00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:17.625
For me, it's the two of you.
I think they know zombies the best.

00:41:19.865 --> 00:41:21.265
Does anyone disagree?

00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:32.425
Then, it's settled.

00:41:35.105 --> 00:41:38.345
Welcome, boss.
Do what you want to do.

00:41:42.065 --> 00:41:44.705
I think the plan we came up
with is already solid.

00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:47.665
But it needs to be tighter

00:41:47.745 --> 00:41:50.705
to ensure that each of us
faces the least risk of death.

00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:54.865
Thi,

00:41:55.745 --> 00:41:58.865
I want you to stay in the decoy
position as before.

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:03.425
But you stay inside the room.

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:06.825
And you don't have to come outside.

00:42:08.785 --> 00:42:10.705
We're not luring it into the room.

00:42:11.585 --> 00:42:14.145
We just want to get its attention.

00:42:15.385 --> 00:42:16.345
Sound good?

00:42:16.985 --> 00:42:18.025
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:22.705
Me too.

00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:26.825
The golden rule is that we start
and end in the maid's room.

00:42:29.145 --> 00:42:32.625
Remember, if it doesn't come in,
we can't do anything.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:36.345
And we will have to call it off.

00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:41.025
If Aunty Jit keeps her routine as usual,

00:42:41.105 --> 00:42:43.505
she will be the first to arrive
at the building.

00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:44.945
This means that…

00:42:46.265 --> 00:42:48.505
we have to get to the spot before her.

00:42:52.385 --> 00:42:55.505
We have no time left.
Let's get our stuff and move.

00:42:56.065 --> 00:42:57.105
Wait.

00:42:57.185 --> 00:43:00.265
Now we have hood, multi colored fabric,

00:43:00.345 --> 00:43:03.785
boxing gloves, a long staff,
cable, a tie, and rope. Anything else?

00:43:04.345 --> 00:43:06.185
-No.
-Okay. Let's go.

00:43:06.265 --> 00:43:07.585
I'll lead the way.

00:43:19.225 --> 00:43:20.745
What else can we believe?

00:43:21.425 --> 00:43:23.465
Everything started with bullshit.

00:43:24.265 --> 00:43:25.785
And things about my mom,

00:43:25.865 --> 00:43:29.025
and that fucking serum
which turns a human into a god.

00:43:29.105 --> 00:43:32.905
However, right now the government's
surely seeking a solution.

00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:34.585
We have all the information.

00:43:35.985 --> 00:43:39.185
-We need to bring all of this to--
-To whom?

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:42.025
He will kill us.

00:43:42.105 --> 00:43:44.545
The last time we went on the roof,
they open fired.

00:43:45.345 --> 00:43:46.665
Ning, take it easy.

00:43:47.385 --> 00:43:50.225
Before this, we knew nothing about it.

00:43:50.305 --> 00:43:52.265
Running away was only our choice.

00:43:52.905 --> 00:43:55.185
But right now,
we have all the information.

00:43:55.945 --> 00:43:57.465
If we do nothing about this,

00:43:57.625 --> 00:44:00.265
then we will be just like those people
who started it.

00:44:05.545 --> 00:44:08.025
You're so totally yourself, you know that?

00:44:08.985 --> 00:44:10.385
You're so totally yourself.

00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:12.505
Why don't you get it?

00:44:13.505 --> 00:44:15.305
I am the cause of it all.

00:44:16.545 --> 00:44:18.905
My mom's excuse is me and Non.

00:44:18.985 --> 00:44:21.705
The two of us are the reason
that all those people died.

00:44:22.705 --> 00:44:24.105
I killed your brother.

00:44:24.185 --> 00:44:25.705
I am the reason he died.

00:44:27.905 --> 00:44:29.025
Why?

00:44:30.105 --> 00:44:32.305
The truth is right in front of you.

00:44:32.385 --> 00:44:34.705
You still don't think about
what is possible.

00:44:35.785 --> 00:44:38.425
Like when you encouraged me
to do the job with Wiroj.

00:44:38.985 --> 00:44:40.825
What is wrong with you, Jean?

00:44:41.905 --> 00:44:45.905
Have you ever thought about
how guilty I would feel?

00:45:03.105 --> 00:45:04.065
Ning.

00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:06.425
Ning.

00:45:08.385 --> 00:45:10.385
Remember what Wiroj said
in the video?

00:45:11.065 --> 00:45:14.185
He said he can now detect
infected immortal jellyfish.

00:45:44.345 --> 00:45:45.425
Chaiwut?

00:45:46.905 --> 00:45:48.065
Chaiwut Kiatpipat.

00:45:49.225 --> 00:45:50.265
It's Joe's.

00:45:55.465 --> 00:45:56.305
Ning.

00:45:56.385 --> 00:45:58.785
When you asked him to pick up your mom…

00:45:59.865 --> 00:46:01.705
did Wiroj tell you where he was?

00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:07.025
Are you outside right now?

00:46:07.145 --> 00:46:08.865
Please pick my mom up.

00:46:09.465 --> 00:46:11.465
Okay, Ning. I will take care of her.

00:46:15.825 --> 00:46:18.225
Date of manufacture. It was on the 15th.

00:46:18.545 --> 00:46:20.185
The same day everything happened.

00:46:21.385 --> 00:46:23.905
It means that this serum
is the latest one.

00:46:24.745 --> 00:46:25.985
If Joe's serum is here…

00:46:27.665 --> 00:46:29.425
then where is your mom's?

00:46:32.785 --> 00:46:36.465
What Wiroj did is bad, and that's true.

00:46:37.705 --> 00:46:39.065
But it's also true…

00:46:41.305 --> 00:46:42.825
that he really loves your mom.

00:46:43.625 --> 00:46:47.225
And I believe that he will never give up

00:46:48.145 --> 00:46:50.705
until he finds a way to cure your mom.

00:46:55.585 --> 00:46:56.825
It will be possible.

00:46:57.825 --> 00:46:59.585
Because if it ends like this,

00:47:00.865 --> 00:47:05.065
Pao and I will be his only CSR activity.

00:47:07.585 --> 00:47:11.305
I actually have no idea what to do.

00:47:12.025 --> 00:47:15.745
But the information we've got,
and this serum…

00:47:18.745 --> 00:47:22.345
It might help someone from outside
put an end to all of this.

00:48:06.545 --> 00:48:10.585
There are a lot of them on the outside.
We'll walk to the back of the building.

00:48:11.145 --> 00:48:13.465
We have to be on standby before 6 p.m.

00:48:14.065 --> 00:48:17.025
Earth will lead us
because he knows best about the way.

00:48:22.505 --> 00:48:25.505
What are you doing?
Why are you standing there?

00:48:30.185 --> 00:48:31.465
Come here!

00:48:35.105 --> 00:48:36.705
I wish you guys rot in hell.

00:48:37.305 --> 00:48:38.865
Hey, don't!

00:48:43.705 --> 00:48:44.905
What the hell?

00:48:49.025 --> 00:48:50.385
Everyone! Quiet!

00:48:52.665 --> 00:48:54.425
We need to stick to the plan.

00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:58.545
What if we need to back off?
Where can we go?

00:48:58.665 --> 00:49:01.145
There's no other way.

00:49:02.265 --> 00:49:04.545
I will do it instead of Earth.

00:49:05.225 --> 00:49:06.705
But what if I fail?

00:49:07.345 --> 00:49:09.785
You're going to be the one
to do it for me.

00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:16.265
Aek once brought us
to the main auditorium.

00:49:16.345 --> 00:49:18.305
I still can remember the way.

00:49:19.905 --> 00:49:21.265
Then you lead us.

00:49:51.465 --> 00:49:52.625
Ning.

00:49:56.905 --> 00:50:00.425
What are you going to do?
You can leave it here.

00:50:03.345 --> 00:50:04.465
No.

00:50:08.945 --> 00:50:10.825
I think everyone should know.

00:50:30.145 --> 00:50:31.465
Can I have a moment?

00:50:34.105 --> 00:50:35.145
Hmm.

00:50:56.665 --> 00:50:58.385
Everything will get better.

00:51:02.105 --> 00:51:04.185
It's really will get better, Pao.

00:51:06.505 --> 00:51:07.825
I never told you…

00:51:11.505 --> 00:51:13.585
how proud I am of you.

00:51:35.945 --> 00:51:37.665
Rest well, my brother.

00:51:54.825 --> 00:51:56.065
Thank you.

00:52:00.105 --> 00:52:02.145
Thank you for staying by my side.

00:52:25.785 --> 00:52:27.145
I think it's clear.

00:52:28.265 --> 00:52:29.345
Let's go.

00:52:29.785 --> 00:52:31.145
Be careful.

00:52:51.265 --> 00:52:53.065
It's like what you all said.

00:52:53.145 --> 00:52:56.425
All the zombies go back to their routine.

00:52:59.345 --> 00:53:00.985
This is our only chance

00:53:01.065 --> 00:53:02.825
before all the zombies come back.

00:53:04.105 --> 00:53:07.065
Everyone, if things go wrong,

00:53:07.145 --> 00:53:10.065
send each other a signal right away
to call it off.

00:53:11.905 --> 00:53:12.945
Let's do it.

00:53:57.105 --> 00:53:58.105
They're all gone.

00:54:17.185 --> 00:54:18.705
Where are they going?

00:54:24.585 --> 00:54:26.185
The other side is in position.

00:54:27.425 --> 00:54:28.705
Wait for the team above.

00:54:45.025 --> 00:54:46.105
Hurry up.

00:55:16.145 --> 00:55:17.985
Is this really going to work?

00:55:20.625 --> 00:55:21.465
It has to.

00:55:56.785 --> 00:55:57.625
Pull.

00:55:57.945 --> 00:55:58.785
Take it off.

00:55:59.145 --> 00:56:00.785
Push. Swing.

00:56:00.865 --> 00:56:02.025
Repeat after me.

00:56:03.905 --> 00:56:04.825
Pull.

00:56:05.945 --> 00:56:06.785
Push.

00:56:07.505 --> 00:56:08.345
Push.

00:56:09.225 --> 00:56:10.065
Swing.

00:56:11.065 --> 00:56:11.905
Well done.

00:56:13.265 --> 00:56:14.145
Before pulling…

00:56:15.625 --> 00:56:17.825
we will drop this substance
inside it first.

00:56:18.945 --> 00:56:22.345
But be careful. You must not open the lid.

00:56:23.025 --> 00:56:24.705
Only open when you will use it.

00:56:24.785 --> 00:56:26.025
Do you understand?

00:56:29.665 --> 00:56:31.625
Each of you should carry two pieces.

00:56:44.025 --> 00:56:45.665
Is this really going to work?

00:56:48.545 --> 00:56:49.705
Why don't we try?

00:56:49.785 --> 00:56:50.785
No!

00:56:52.425 --> 00:56:54.985
These substances are highly toxic.

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:57.825
Spray them as close
to their faces as possible.

00:56:58.625 --> 00:56:59.905
Night, are you sure?

00:57:01.665 --> 00:57:02.865
Around 80%.

00:57:02.945 --> 00:57:03.785
Oh.

00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:05.985
What about the other 20%?

00:57:06.545 --> 00:57:08.105
Nothing can be 100% sure.

00:57:13.185 --> 00:57:17.225
Are we going to leave Lily here?

00:57:24.705 --> 00:57:25.545
Wait.

00:57:26.625 --> 00:57:28.545
When did she become this quiet?

00:57:28.625 --> 00:57:30.225
Have any of you noticed?

00:57:36.785 --> 00:57:38.105
When it rained heavily…

00:57:39.985 --> 00:57:41.065
After…

00:57:41.985 --> 00:57:43.025
Sun…

00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:52.985
I'll be there with her.

00:58:01.865 --> 00:58:05.145
You know,
Lily wouldn't want you to do this.

00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:07.465
I know.

00:58:08.145 --> 00:58:11.105
But as you all can see,
my friend is still in there.

00:58:13.825 --> 00:58:15.465
I won't leave my friend alone.

00:58:23.145 --> 00:58:24.425
I got you.

00:58:27.345 --> 00:58:29.185
I only have Pao left.

00:58:30.425 --> 00:58:31.665
I'll find him.

00:58:37.985 --> 00:58:39.145
This is ricin.

00:58:40.265 --> 00:58:42.305
You might need it later.
Carry it with you.

00:58:51.065 --> 00:58:52.745
Promise me this, Win.

00:58:54.745 --> 00:58:55.985
Please don't die.

00:58:56.905 --> 00:58:59.345
I passed the audition
to join your thesis project.

00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:01.585
Got it!

00:59:02.385 --> 00:59:04.545
I'll survive this to do my thesis project.

00:59:13.985 --> 00:59:16.145
Is everything okay? Are you all ready?

00:59:22.585 --> 00:59:23.905
Game.

00:59:23.985 --> 00:59:26.665
Stop crying. Be strong for our brothers.

00:59:26.745 --> 00:59:28.705
I'm sorry, it's just…

00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:30.905
I can't stop!

00:59:33.745 --> 00:59:34.825
Don't worry.

00:59:35.745 --> 00:59:38.105
From now on, we will take care of you.

00:59:44.265 --> 00:59:45.745
And what's wrong with you?

00:59:45.825 --> 00:59:47.905
-So touching.
-Did I say something wrong?

00:59:48.905 --> 00:59:49.745
No, nothing.

00:59:53.705 --> 00:59:54.945
Thank you so much.

01:00:04.905 --> 01:00:06.065
Let's go!

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:11.305
Let's go to Gus.
