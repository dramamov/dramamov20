00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.870
Slow down.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.870
Morning.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.580
Feeling any better?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.190
Mengmeng.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.390
Listen to your teacher today at school.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.700
Find your seat in the classroom.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.260
Mengmeng.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.430
Feeling better?

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.870
A bit better.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.590
Come into the classroom.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.740
- She's at a key stage of recovery.
- Slowly.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.860
Ideally, she should come
four times a week for rehab.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.220
Teacher.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.300
Can we start with two sessions
a week first?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.710
That brings totally different results.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.150
Without reinforcements,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.020
she probably won't improve
even after a month.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.300
The golden recovery period
is really short.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.260
If you miss it and start later,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.820
it'll take a lot more time and effort.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.060
Can we do the sessions at home?

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.620
Mengmeng and I will work really hard.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.820
If you really can't make it,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.060
you can get an affordable machine

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.180
and practice at home.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.470
But you have to stick with it.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.550
Okay.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.740
If the situation allows,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.820
it's best to come here for the therapy.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.860
If you can help her develop
some hobbies,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.280
like painting

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.380
and playing an instrument,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.620
it'll really help

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.060
with her cognitive growth.

How many times this month?

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.620
Didn't I tell you

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.060
to be on time today?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.500
Manager,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.710
I had to drop Mengmeng off
at kindergarten.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.060
Please cut me some slack.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.710
I won't be late again this month.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.590
Alright, you're our top seller.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.380
Go on then.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.340
Okay.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.870
Hello.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.300
Do you like how it looks?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.740
Zhang Yan, bring the tableware.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.500
Tidy up those tables now.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.520
- Okay.
- They've left.

Mengmeng.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.780
Mengmeng.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.380
Wait a bit longer.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.920
- We'll go home soon.
- Waiter.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.480
Where's my beer? It's taking forever.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.340
Coming.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.810
Thanks for helping out the other day.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.280
Are you feeling better now?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.380
I just wasn't used to the place.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.260
Nothing serious.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.380
I don't think I've seen you before.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.940
I just moved here.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.380
Let me buy you dinner sometime

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.500
to thank you.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.180
If you want to thank me,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.740
teach my daughter how to paint.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.740
You know I can paint?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.940
I saw an art book at your place.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.500
Those drawings were yours, right?

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.260
I'm not good enough

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.860
to be a teacher.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.990
It's okay.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.260
I just want her to develop a hobby.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.740
When people have something they enjoy,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.620
they're usually a lot happier.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.820
Then I'll give it a try.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.710
My name's Zhang Yan.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.300
Just call me Danshun.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.860
I'm full.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.830
You're full?

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.190
There are so many carrots left.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.140
The bunny won't come
and play with you tonight.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.670
Mengmeng.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.070
The painting teacher will be here soon.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.950
Let's get ready, okay?

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.310
No.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.830
Learning to paint is fun.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.710
Mengmeng.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.830
Sorry about that.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.950
She's a bit moody today.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.190
Your name is Mengmeng, right?

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.830
Look what I brought for you.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.780
A little fish.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.070
It started swimming in spring

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.710
and kept going until winter.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.570
Then it got trapped in the ice.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.470
When spring returned,

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.430
the ice melted away.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.590
Do you like it?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:25.830
Why not watch it again?

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.070
Sure.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.230
It started swimming in spring

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.710
and kept going until winter.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.930
Then it got trapped in the ice.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.780
One more time.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.230
Mengmeng, do you like it?

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.350
I do.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.110
How about I teach you to make one?

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.950
Okay.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.430
Come on.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.830
Can I borrow your paintbrush?

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.710
Start with the duck's round little head.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.900
This part is the beak.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.590
Then the body.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.310
Don't forget its tiny wings.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.210
Mengmeng, give it a try.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.310
Here, have some fruit.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:47.790
Thank you.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.070
I'm heading out.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.470
I'll be back soon.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.660
(Inpatient Building)

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.710
The last payment is almost used up.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.230
Should I ask her son to pay or you?

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.590
I'll handle it later.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.350
What's the point

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.230
of raising a son?

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.950
He just dropped her off,

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.470
leaving everything to you.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.990
You're not even her daughter.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.350
She once saved my life.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.780
That was a long time ago.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.350
You've already repaid that debt.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.070
Mom.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.950
Take it slow.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.710
Here.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.380
Let's go.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.830
Take your time.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:46.670
No hurry.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.310
Did you draw this?

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.910
It's amazing.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.310
Have a seat.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.950
Mengmeng.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.540
Class is over for today.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.590
Time to do some exercise.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.070
I don't want to exercise.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.590
I want to keep drawing.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.310
Uncle Danshun can come next time.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.660
No.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.830
Mengmeng.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.070
Listen to your mom;
it's time to exercise.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.110
Good girl.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.230
I'll teach you to draw something else.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.070
Okay?

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.030
Come on.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.590
Let's take the stairs.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.590
Thanks.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.110
I left the class fee by the door.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.790
Take it slow.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.310
Take off your shoes.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.950
That's the last one.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.230
Bye, Mengmeng.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.710
Bye, Uncle.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.590
Come on.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.830
Go slower. Yeah.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.860
(Hong)

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.220

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.310
Hello.

Your dishes are ready.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.780
Mengmeng, sit back down.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.350
Serve the dishes.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:31.990
Your dishes are ready.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.430
Mengmeng.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.070
It's crowded here; sit over here.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.150
Come on.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.430
Don't disturb me right now.

Mom! Mom!

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.190
What's wrong?

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.020
What's wrong?

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.753
What's wrong?

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.430
What happened?

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.900
Just now,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:11.950
I was cooking.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.990
She was beside me
and seemed to get splashed by oil.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.430
- Where is it?
- Let me look.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.820
She got burned.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.580
Zhang Yan, come here.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.820
Take her to the hospital now.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.570
No need.
I'll just put some sesame oil on it.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.910
Zhang Yan, I'm not blaming you.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.810
But it's really risky keeping her here.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.390
There's either hot oil or open flames.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.950
And cars keep passing by.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.230
If something happens to the kid,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.740
I can't take that responsibility.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.710
Hurry up.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.260
Take the kid to get checked.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:40.910
It's fine.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.950
Everyone, enjoy.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.790
It's okay.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.780
Go on, go on.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.100
Danshun,

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.710
do you have plans tonight?

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.860
No.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.470
I need a favor,

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:10.950
but I'm not sure.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.230
What's wrong?

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.430
Can you give Mengmeng
another lesson tonight?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.190
I won't be back until 11 pm.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.340
No problem.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.910
You didn't take the fee
for the last lesson.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.430
Plus this time.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.270
Here.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.540
I'm not in a rush for money.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.430
Just keep it for me.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.160
Come on, cheers!

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.020
- Cheers!
- Drink!

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.860
Come on.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.990
Right.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.540
Left.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.430
Right.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.190
I'll join you, okay?

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.830
Someone's back.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.430
Mom.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.740
After class, I thought I'd help her
with some rehab exercises.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.640
You know how to do that, too?

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.020
I looked it up online.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.260
No extra charge for this part.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.260
The stir-fried noodles are free, either.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.950
Your accent doesn't sound local.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.500
I'm from Chencang.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.950
Oh, from the north.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.990
It snows

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.950
in winter there, right?

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.230
Yes, every winter.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.910
It snows almost every day.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.990
I've never seen real snow before.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.710
If I ever get the chance
to visit in winter,

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.710
I'll take Mengmeng to see the snow.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.740
It gets freezing cold in my hometown.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.390
A friend of mine
has been to Pingtan before.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.740
She told me

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.950
it always feels like spring here.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.100
There's no real winter.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.190
Who said that?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.710
Winters here are tough.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.810
There's no heating at all.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.830
Even the blanket feels damp
and cold when you sleep.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.470
Seems no place has

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.390
an easy winter.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.710
What brought you to Pingtan?

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.670
I'm here looking for someone.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:56.910
Have you found them yet?

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.260
We haven't gotten in touch.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.710
Are you from around here?

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.630
I'm from Shimen.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.870
That's the outskirts of Pingtan.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.950
The medical care is better in the city,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.570
so it's easier for me to treat Mengmeng.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.260
Was Mengmeng born with it?

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.180
No.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.950
She had a high fever
when she was just over one.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.430
It lasted for three days.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.990
When she finally recovered,

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.230
I felt like her movements
weren't coordinated.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.690
She also developed more slowly
than other kids.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.810
The doctor said
it was due to a brain injury.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.190
What about Mengmeng's father?

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.740
He was a sailor.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.150
He passed away while out at sea.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.870
The doctor told me

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.150
that Mengmeng's condition

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.910
can be recovered
if we keep up with rehab.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.990
So, there's still hope.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.140
I keep thinking

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.260
that if there's hope,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.100
life can keep moving forward.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.710
People just need something
to hold on to.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.230
Once you have that, life can go on.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.780
Mengmeng is what I hold on to.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.190
If there's hope,

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.950
life can keep moving forward.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.710
Hello?

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.450
Hello, Zhang Yan.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.290
Li Bingmei's condition
isn't looking good.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.200
Come here now.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:51.950
Okay.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.020
I'm on my way now.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.950
Keep monitoring her.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.790
Got it.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.540
Doctor, how is she?

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.950
Her organs are failing.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.500
She might not make it through the night.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.390
You should prepare yourself.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.950
Can you try something else?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.910
It's already a miracle
she's made it so far.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.990
If it weren't for your determination,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.950
she wouldn't have lasted until now.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.100
Really.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.630
If this continues,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.340
it's just unbearable

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.910
for both you and her.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:44.670
Try to let go.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:26.230
Hey.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.950
I can't pick up Mengmeng now.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.470
Can you do that for me?

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.340
Sure, don't worry about it.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.710
Thanks.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.790
No problem.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:01.790
Zhang Yan.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.290
You've got the nerve to show up here.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.470
Stop pretending to be nice.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.230
Listen. If my mom dies today,

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.260
I won't let this go.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.740
Please, keep it down.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.740
- Patients are resting.
- Stop playing the victim.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.710
- Let go.
- Where's my mom's money?

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.260
My mom ended up like this

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.110
because she tricked

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.630
my mom out of all her savings.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.340
If you don't return her money today,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.870
- you can't leave.
- Lower our voices.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:23.810
My voice is low enough!

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.190
Where's the money you took?

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.430
Where's my mom's money?

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.540
What are you trying to do?

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.190
What am I doing?

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.260
Ask her what she's doing.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.790
Say it yourself.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.710
You won't talk, huh?

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.740
I'll say it for you.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.340
My mom ended up like this

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.500
because she scammed

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.710
my mom out of all her savings.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.260
She's a total fraud.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.190
Why still defend her?

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.710
She's a con artist.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.150
Say something!

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.540
Doctor, the patient's dying!

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.670
Mom.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.070
Mom! How is she?

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.540
Nurse, how's my mom doing?

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.710
Continue CPR.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.780
Doctor, please save my mom!

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.310
Mom.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.100
Try to stay calm.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.940
Take it easy.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.590
Doctor, please save my mom!

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.230
Take it easy.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.070
Mom.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.390
1 mg of adrenaline, now!

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.740
Go home now.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.550
Mengmeng.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.340
Time to head home.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.910
I keep thinking

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.340
that if there's hope,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.710
life can keep moving forward.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:55.710
Mom.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.950
You're up so early.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.950
Mom, will Uncle Danshun

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.910
give me another class today?

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.230
He's got things to take care of.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.500
He can't come to teach you often now.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.430
Mengmeng.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.470
Let me take a look.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.510
Okay.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.470
I want to take you somewhere.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.340
Uncle Danshun.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:53.990
Mengmeng.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.670
I'm taking you out to have some fun.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.620
Okay?

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.870
Sure.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.870
I once made a promise with a friend

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.370
that we'd come here to watch the sea.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.230
Unexpectedly, I came alone later.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.870
I've been in Pingtan for so long.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.740
Honestly, life here hasn't been hopeful.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.390
If not for you and Mengmeng,

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.950
I'd probably still be living aimlessly.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:46.470
Danshun.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.470
I've done some things I'm not proud of.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.230
I may not be as good as you think.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.470
I'm not perfect, either.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.430
But didn't you once say

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.190
that sometimes, to keep going,

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.670
you just need something to hold on to?

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.020
That is right here for you.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.780
Look ahead.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.390
I've also found something new
to hold on to.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.820
(Huayan Hall)

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.580
(Solemn and Serene)

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.190
I think I've been to this temple before.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.620
(Afterlife Tablet of the Departed:
Li Bingmei)

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.470
Let me carry her instead.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.310
It's fine.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.340
(Prayer ribbon; Name: Chen)

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.100
Thanks.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:13.300
(Prayer ribbon;
Chen Yiting, Lyu Danshun)

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:59.660
(Chen Yiting, Lyu Danshun;
Peace and good fortune)

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.300
(Fraud suspect: Zhang Yan)

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:08.710
Chief Liu.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.180
Eat something first.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.500
You mean

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.270
Zhang Yan is

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:29.950
at the center of the whole thing?

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.020
Not completely sure.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.180
But look at this.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.540
She's the only one
connected to everyone.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.790
In Ma Weicheng's account,

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.390
Zhang Yan is a con artist.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.660
She's good at using
romantic relationships

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.310
to get what she wants.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.100
When she got close to Lyu Danshun,

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:50.140
it was for the same reason.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.900
(Zhang Yan)

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.840
(Qin Hong; Accomplice)

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.100
(Money)

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.830
What if Zhang Yan

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.430
noticed this stash of money

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.140
and that was why she dated Lyu Danshun?

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.910
If Lyu Danshun

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.870
found out about that,

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.500
could that be Qin Hong

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.350
and his motive

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.500
(Zhang Yan)
to kill her?

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:25.830
Ms. Sun.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.100
(Accommodation)

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.580
(Police)

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.470
Is it them?

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.470
Yes.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:16.910
Are they still here?

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:18.470
I think so.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.310
Have two people guard the door.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.580
Take us there to check.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.380
(Guest Room)

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.270
This is the room.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.950
Uncle Danshun.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.090
Xiaoxiao.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.220
Block him over there!

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.100
Stop!

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.950
Don't run!

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.140
Stop!

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.220
Xiaoxiao!

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:21.910
Stop!

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.580
Hong, go! There's no time.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.830
- What about you?
- Go!

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:29.670
Stop right there!

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:31.710
Go!

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.470
Lyu Danshun!

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.390
Lyu Danshun, open the door!

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.850
Xiaoxiao, catch Qin Hong!

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.790
Got it!

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:54.230
Let go!

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:56.950
Lyu Danshun!

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.950
What a surprise.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.990
The one I was waiting for
in Chang'an Town

00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.990
was Qin Hong.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:01.310
It was Zhang Yan.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.060
Stop twisting the truth.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.990
What shocked me even more is

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.220
that to clear Qin Hong's name,

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.950
you killed an innocent girl

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.660
and made her your scapegoat.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.470
Zhang Yan was never a scapegoat.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.270
Why did you kill her?

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.060
If it was not because you wanted

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.660
to find a scapegoat for Qin Hong

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.870
and approached her,

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.470
it must be because you knew
she had deceived you.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.350
When you were in Chang'an Town,

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.310
you used Zhang Yan's name

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.140
and transferred 200,000
to Qin Hong's mother, Wei Tinglan.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.540
You said it was money
you'd saved from working.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.830
But after investigating in Pingtan,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.750
we found you only had one job
at a tattoo studio,

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.350
earning 5,500 a month.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.150
You couldn't possibly save
200,000 in a year.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.700
Where did that money come from?

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.630
I saved it myself.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:12.950
Still lying, huh?

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.220
Lu Danshun,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.100
you're still lying now?

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.580
After Huang Shuquan was killed,

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.310
one of his men gave us a statement.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.140
That night, there was 600,000

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.470
in cash at Tian Cai.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.060
But we never found that money.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.430
Qin Hong was on the run.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.470
She couldn't have carried
that money around.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.660
If you were involved in the murder

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.620
of Huang Shuquan,

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.950
you must be the one keeping the cash.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.350
Where's my stuff?

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.750
You lied to me,

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.500
saying Qin Hong never contacted you.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.220
But actually,
you helped her bring that money

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.950
from Chencang to Pingtan, right?

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.450
The funds sent to Wei Tinglan
came from that money.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.270
You also killed Zhang Yan

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.830
because of that money, right?

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.580
Where did you hide Zhang Yan's body?

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.220
Officer Liu,
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.620
Lyu Danshun.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.020
I'm giving you a chance now.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.140
Look at you now.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.200
Was it really worth it?

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.540
(Chief Chen is calling)

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.470
Got it, Chief Chen.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.110
What happened?

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.740
Ma Weicheng changed his statement.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.990
He changed his statement?
