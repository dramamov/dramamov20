Chusheng!

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.480
Now say it.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.220
What "misunderstanding" is it?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.920
Duke,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.710
there's no need to rush.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.750
A centipede may be dying,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.910
but its legs still twitch.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.360
The Wei clan has been nobles for a century,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.710
quiet on the surface,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960
but they may

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.750
still have a lifeline.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.960
Now

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.680
only Wei Yun remains.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.000
If we want the Wei family gone,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.400
we can't strike too hastily.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.590
Otherwise, why would

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.590
His Majesty defend the Wei family,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.630
yet keep you back alone afterward?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.840
Makes sense.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680
Haven't you always wanted

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.520
to be Minister of Justice?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.430
Now that the position is vacant,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.520
I'll speak

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.710
to His Majesty in a few days

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.710
so you can get some "experience" there.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.030
Thank you, Duke.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.310
Chusheng,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.520
is your throat alright?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.520
Your hand

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.240
burned?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.520
It's nothing.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.520
But since I'll soon

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.120
be reassigned elsewhere,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.310
I need to finish

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.190
the Hanlin Academy drafts.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.030
Rest early.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.160
(You once said:)

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.160
(A woman's knees hold gold.)

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.390
(You must not kneel lightly.)

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.720
(You knelt once for your father and brother.)

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.360
(Yet today you knelt outside the palace)

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.440
(for people)

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.950
(unrelated to you.)

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.030
No.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.720
The Wei family isn't safe.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.600
It's a thorn in Duke of Ning's

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.480
eye.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.630
I can't let her stay there.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.110
Father,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.230
look at my painting! How is it?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.900
(Long Life Like a Turtle)

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.830
I wish Father a long, turtle-like life!

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.910
How is it, Father?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.000
No, no.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720
Yun's grown now.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.840
- You rascal!
- Father!

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.040

Jun,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.480
you're the Young General Wei,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.830
so you should be both warrior and scholar.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.750
But should I be that too?

not scholars,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.110
but we still

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.110

shut himself in his room

worried.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.040
Since

you helped me

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.240
before,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.550
maybe you can help him

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.510
break the block in his heart.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.720
There is a way.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.670

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.390
in this world.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.510
Give her the divorce paper for me.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.390
Let her go.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.600
Jiu had it hard enough in the Xie family.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.840
After marrying me,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.790
she lived in worries.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.340
I don't want her to spend her life as a widow.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.910
Uncle Yun!

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:17.750
Uncle Yun!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.870
Uncle Yun!

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.150
When will you come out?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.030
Mother and aunts

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.790
are waiting for you outside.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.390
Uncle Yun,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.630
please come out,

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.390
everyone's worried.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.120
I got it.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.590
Wei Yun,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.600
your life used to be calm

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.360
because your father and brothers

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.200
shielded you.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.560
Now you are

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.390
the Wei family's only backbone.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.320
You must hold up

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.240
the sky for them

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.910
and protect everyone under this roof.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.870
The Wei house

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.240
needs you to restore its honor.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.790
Besides, you must investigate

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.910
what really happened

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.750
at Baidi Valley

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.870
and root out the truth.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.390
If we can't slay

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.230
those North Qi soldiers,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.030
how can we answer

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.960
the seventy thousand fallen?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.750
Don't let them rest in vain.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.120
I dreamed my brothers told me

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.360
not to trap you

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.150
in the Wei household.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.000
I agree as well.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.380
(Divorce Paper)

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.260
(Defend the nation and the throne)
Today,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.270
I gave you divorce papers

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.200
on my brothers' behalf,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.030
but you will always be my family.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.360
Although you have the papers now,

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.550
packing

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.390
takes time.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.360
Don't rush.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.600
If you do not wish to leave,

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.080
the Wei family won't drive you away.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.960
If you ever want to return,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.480
our gates

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720
remain open.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.590
Yun,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.870
Yu,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.080
thank you.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.960
I planned

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.240
to wait until things were certain,

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.910
but seeing the situation now,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.870
I decided to tell you now.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.070
My brother works in the Ministry of Personnel,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.390
he sent word yesterday

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.080
that the court is preparing to confer

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.480
the Marquis of Zhenguo title on Yun.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.110
After all we suffered,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.680
at least there's good news.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.110
Yes, from

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.370
extreme hardship comes relief.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.480
Congratulations to you, Yun.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.350
Congrats.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.840
This is

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.400
a major event for the Wei household.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.640
Why not

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.310
stay until

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.310
the enfeoffment banquet?

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.750
We can

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.790
stay with the children

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.630
a few more days

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.910
and

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.000
help make a showing

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.880
for Yun's new rank.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.950
What do you say?

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.310
This is a good idea.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.480
The Wei family

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.480
is not what it used to be.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.240
The banquet

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.590
will show

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.790
who truly

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.880
stands with us

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.000
and give you a proper send-off.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.430
It's good.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.590
Our Wei family

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.000
needs such an occasion.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.790
Yes, let's go.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.000
Let's go get ready.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.540
(Divorce Paper)

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.930
(Divorce Paper)

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.800
What is this?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.720
You're still young,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.110
remarrying

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.950
wouldn't be hard.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.070
You and my brother

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.910
barely knew each other.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.240
You were not deep in love.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.070
If you take this divorce paper today,

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.310
I'll assume you stayed

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.200
only out of righteousness.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.720
I won't

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640
probe further.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.070
When I inherit the title,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.310
I'll speak well of Young General Chu.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.510
The Wei family will remember your kindness.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.880
Have you forgotten

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.720
our agreement?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.790
If I rescue you,

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.240
you can't drive me away.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.320
Otherwise

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.270
if I can save you,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.160
I can send you back too.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.830
I didn't know

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.960
you had such skills.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.980
(Divorce Paper)

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.750
I've always been unruly

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.480
and unorthodox.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.070
If you don't believe that,

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.390
test me.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.340
(Defend the nation and the throne)

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.560
My Lord,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.240
you still don't trust Lady Chu?

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.070
She's done so much for the Wei family.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.790
I feel indebted to her.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.110
I once urged her

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.270
not to bind herself here.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.070
But which sister

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.640
does not love

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.000
this family?

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.000
They too might leave.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.110
I tried to bribe her,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.510
but she insisted on staying.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.720
How can I trust her?

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.350
She tries so hard

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.350
to stay in the Wei family.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.400
She must have her motives.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.350
If so,

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.350
just

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.510
throw her out.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.830
Even without proof,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.000
what can she do?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.910
Wei Qiu,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.480
if a tiger always

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.510
covets your flesh,

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.880
do you keep it nearby

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.960
and lock it up,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.750
or do you

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.030
drive it away,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.790
constantly scared?

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.030
You mean it's safer

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.310
to keep Lady Chu

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.640
in the open

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.440
and watch her.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.550
So your promise

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.480
in jail

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960
was also for this?

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.350
If she's treacherous,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.070
if we do nothing,

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.240
she'll show her hand.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.160
You'll have people watch her

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.440
and report whom she meets

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.350
and what she does

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.480
every day.

Chu Yu!

You're making a scene at the Wei gate.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.490
What sort of behavior is this?

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.310
Chu Yu,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.260
marrying into the Wei family

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.110
is one thing,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.550
but why must you drag our brother

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.540
and the entire Chu family down?

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.640
Drag him down?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.840
Speak clearly.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.960
Don't play dumb.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.400
Do you not know that today

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.160
Gu Chusheng impeached him in court

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.590
for "overly close ties" with the Wei family,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.960
asking for his removal?

Gu Chusheng impeached Linyang

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.030
asking for his removal?

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.790
Has he gone mad?

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.640
If you hadn't married into the Wei family

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.750
and made that petty man jealous,

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.110
why would he kick us

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.110
when the Chu family

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.030
is already struggling?

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.880
He's always been petty.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.920
But how did you hear of this?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.840
Speak up.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.590
Why did you ask me here?

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.790
We're hardly friends.

Chu Yu is fickle

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.270
and faithless.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.030
I only want to know

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.640
whether she truly

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.590
loves Wei Jun.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.640
With her nature,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.070
it's not strange for her

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.240
to suddenly fancy someone.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240
You care this much,

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.550
don't tell me

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.880
you still have feelings for her.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.880
Do you really think you're a phoenix

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.270
just because you climbed high?

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.270
You think our Chu family

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.400
needs your trifling gifts?

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.160
Lady Jin,

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.720
think nothing of it,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.680
just a token.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.440
But His Majesty

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.920
already dislikes the power

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.270
of military families.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.200
Chu Yu insisted on marrying the Wei clan,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.040
such alliances

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.310
will only make His Majesty wary.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.960
The title of "First Madam" seems grand,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.010
but it will make

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.440
life difficult for the Chu family.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.800
Lady Jin,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.640
persuade your brother to ally

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.480
with the Duke of Ning's family.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.820
Civil and military united,

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.640
only then can great things be achieved.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.110
Don't you dare use my brother

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.950
to threaten me.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.400
Since you're so desperate to pry

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.590
information out of me,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.160
I'll tell you:

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.310
Chu Yu and Wei Jun

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.270
met only a few times.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.440
Talk of true love is nonsense.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.350
Chasing you to the southwest

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.960
showed more devotion.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.160
Since I've spoken

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.000
this much,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.310
I'll accept

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.240
your little gift.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.400
He must think

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.350
the Chu family is weak

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.030
and wants to stir trouble,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.680
tricking you into speaking.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.240
I...

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.920
So what even if I said it?

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.550
I didn't expect him

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.790
to target our brother.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.270
If not for you,

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.200
he wouldn't be scheming

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.040
like this,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.270
our brother wouldn't be facing this.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.880
You caused the trouble.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.110
Why blame me?

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.240
You truly hate me this much?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.350
The Chu family suffers,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.200
yet you live comfortably.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.590
If you don't fix this,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.510
I'll expose your intentions

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.590
to the entire

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.510
Huajing City.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.750
I'll make Wei Yun

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.750
drive you out

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.200
and leave you

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.070
homeless.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.830
What, you'll hit me here too?

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.880
I won't hit you now

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.200
or ever.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.240
Go back.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.640
I'll handle this.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.960
I promise you,

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.350
this

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.590
won't harm you in the slightest.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.880
You'd better keep your word.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.240
She made a mistake,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.310
but why does she put

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.270
all the blame on you?

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.560
My Lady,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.160
why don't you teach her a lesson?

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.880
What did she do wrong?

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.590
Whatever.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.640
Linyang's trouble matters most.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.200
Gu Chusheng,

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.960
if you act without mercy,

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.720
don't blame me for answering in kind.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.640
If he hates peace so much,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.640
I'll give him

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.960
chaos.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.080
Yu.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.510
It's just family matters.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.830
Don't worry.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.240
I can deal with it.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.440
If there's anything we can help with,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.960
just tell us.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.520
Family matters?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.480
I doubt it.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.720
Your marriage to the Wei clan

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.160
already counts

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.000
as an alliance.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.440
My investiture is soon.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.050
How could the officials

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.590
miss such a chance?

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.880
It may seem aimed at your brother,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.440
but its true target is the Chu

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.110
and Wei families together.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.060
So you were eavesdropping.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.390
(Divorce Paper)
If you want a clean solution,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.180
take the divorce paper.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.300
If you return to the Chu family,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.700
Gu Chusheng will naturally

00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.620
drop the impeachment.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.020
Yes, Yu.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.500
Yun's right.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.380
Even if you take the paper,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.940
you're still family to us.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.060
Yu,

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.060
if you've dragged the Chu family down,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.540
how

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.500
will you face your mother?

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.620
Yes, Yu.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.780
You've done so much for both Jun

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.620
and the Wei family.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.020
Think for yourself this time.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.780
Yun,

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.260
help think

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.860
of another way.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.620
I appreciate your goodwill.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.140
I'll thank you

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.580
after it's settled.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.220
As you wish.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.990
(Divorce Paper)
I'll take it.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.020
Wei Qiu,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.100
follow her these days.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.180
Who knows what trouble she'll stir up next.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.380
Yes.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.460
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.300
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)
Absurd!

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.780
Only in the Duke of Ning's Mansion

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.460
can one taste such good tea.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.020
Truly excellent.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.620
Guards!

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.020
Drag her out!

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.780
Lady Wang, calm down.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.820
Perhaps you two

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.260
don't know yet: Gu Chusheng

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.660
impeached my brother.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.340
You know my history

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.500
with him.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.860
He impeached my brother

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.060
to force me out of the Wei family

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.340
so he could reconcile with me.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.060
Now that I've taken the divorce paper,

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.340
if my brother loses his post,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.740
I'll have no choice

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.660
but to be with Gu Chusheng.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.620
Delusion!

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.900
I am his lawful wife.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.740
So what?

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.980
If you

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.940
don't help my brother,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.860
then even as a concubine,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.020
I'll marry into your manor.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.340
Even being his mistress, why not?

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.180
As they say,

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.730
wildflowers smell sweeter than home ones.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.220
How shameless

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.740
can a woman be!

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.180
Chusheng.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.380
Chusheng.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.860
Chusheng.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.060
You're finally back.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.300
I know you still care for me.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.140
Those years

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.780
under the moon, our vows

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.700
to be true forever,

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.060
never part.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.460
Do you remember?

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.780
Yu.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.260
What did you call her?

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.580
Chusheng,

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.060
I know

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.340
our love isn't

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.540
accepted by the world.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.340
For you,

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.700
I will never yield.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.340
Even heaven and earth may end,

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.340
this love never will.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.220
Chu Yu,

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.460
he's my husband.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.380
I already have the divorce paper.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.500
What about you?

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.860
When will you divorce?

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.140
Why didn't you reject her?

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.660
Chusheng,

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.740
did you impeach Chu Linyang

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.820
because you wanted

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.860
to be with her?

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.540
Say something.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.740
Speak!

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.060
Let me explain.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.220
Chusheng.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.060
Enough!

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.860
My Duke of Ning's manor

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.740
has never produced

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.140
such disgraceful conduct!

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.540
You...

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.540
Father!

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.840
- Gu Chusheng!
- My Lord.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.460
Throw that wretch out!

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.900
Have some tea, calm yourself.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.340
(Divorce Paper)

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.780
Chusheng,

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.980
I've fulfilled your wish.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.620
I'll

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.180
wait for your good news.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.540
Are you feeling better?

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.380
Lady Yu.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.340
How coincidental.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.180
Indeed.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.500
Did Wei Yun send you?

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:32.860
No.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.100
It's Lord Yun.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.540
No, no,

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.380
not him.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.380
I...

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.540
I thought Lord Yun

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.780
might worry about you.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.420
So I came.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.860
Yes.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.780
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.500
I don't know

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.340
what I'm saying.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.100
You're not good at lying.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.260
He just doesn't believe

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.060
I'll leave after taking the divorce paper,

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.540
so he sent you to watch me.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.140
Where is he?

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.020
This concerns the Wei family.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.420
I'm fighting on the front lines.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.780
Where has he slipped off to?

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.460
Lord Yun went

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.660
to meet with Lu Qiba today.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.620
He's hard to arrange.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:09.940
Lu Qiba?

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.020
The one at the Arsenal Bureau

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.140
who made the octagonal crossbow?

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.460
Yes.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.100
Look what you've done!

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.420
You'd better tell the truth.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.660
Why did you impeach Chu Linyang?

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.060
Duke, don't believe

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.300
Chu Yu's nonsense.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.180
I impeached him

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.060
to keep Wei Yun from

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.900
inheriting too easily,

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.860
to check the military's growing power.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.020
Chu Yu caused a scene

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.420
only to protect

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.780
her brother's post.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.980
Whatever your motive,

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.460
tomorrow you will report

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.860
to His Majesty

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.020
and withdraw the impeachment.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.180
Chu Yu must

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.020
remain

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.460
the Wei family's First Madam.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.380
Today's scandal must never repeat.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.940
My Duke of Ning's Mansion

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.980
cannot afford such shame.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:11.900
Yes.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.540
I understand.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:48.540
Good move,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.460
Chu Yu.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.940
(Fragrance House)

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.900
So it's agreed.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.020
Don't forget.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:01.860
Remember.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.380
Isn't that Wei Yun?

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.060
The Wei family is in chaos,

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.300
yet he still comes to a place like this.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:07.220
Seems

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.620
the rumors are true.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.980
He's just a naive boy who respects

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.900
father and brothers.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.140
The glory of the Marquis's manor

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.620
ends here.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.980
Sir, I haven't seen you before.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.740
Which girl are you

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.580
looking for?

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.500
A man.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.340
A man?

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.180
Lu Qiba.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.540
Do you know him?

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.180
Oh! You're looking for Master Lu.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.500
No problem.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.260
Let go of that lady!

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.140
(Lu Qiba,
Deputy Commander of the Arsenal Bureau)

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.100
Didn't mean to scare you.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.060
What's in that thing?

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.180
Aphrodisiacs.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.140
What?

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:19.940
Kidding.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.660
This is a secret tool

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.620
for dealing with brutes like you.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.900
After all,

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.020
protecting every young lady

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.860
is my sacred duty.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.620
Ladies,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.580
shout my name!

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.060
Lu Qiba!

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.540
Lu Qiba!

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.260
Lu Qiba!

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.060
I am the man

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.980
everyone adores,

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.260
handsome, clever,

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.300
the best weapons master of Great Sui:

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.340
Lu Qiba.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.780
Young people are

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:50.980
so impatient nowadays.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.420
I don't have time to fool around with you.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.780
Find a quiet place.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.620
We have serious business.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.460
Of course.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.460
Madam Zhang,

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.780
open my private room.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.780
Got it.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.900
Put it on his tab.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.820
So you and Lu Qiba

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.820
are old acquaintances?

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:33.980
What's he like?

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.460
Does he come here often?

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.060
He's a regular.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.820
But we won't casually

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.780
sell others' information.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.740
You'll

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.980
have to check yourself.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.900
Surely you've heard

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.660
of my charm.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.900
Being too handsome

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.020
is a burden.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.100
Of course, Wei,

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.540
this is something

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.420
you wouldn't understand.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.740
You must be General Wei, right?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.500
Truly a young general,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.420
upright,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.820
imposing.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.100
I thought General Wei Jun

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.180
was unmatched,

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.740
but it seems

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.820
you

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.900
surpasses him.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.140
Why are your eyes

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.300
so red?

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.900
Shall I blow

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.260
on them for you?

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.140
You must be blind.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.780
I'm sure of it.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.820
I have important business with Master Lu.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.620
Please leave us for now.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.820
If I offended you,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.860
forgive me.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.500
What a gentleman.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.980
When you're done,

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.420
we sisters

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.460
will be waiting for you.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.300
We'll be waiting.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.500
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.460
So shy.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.980
Haven't seen someone

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.500
this serious in a long time.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.380
Fine.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.620
You're just like Wei Jun,

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.380
boring.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.140
You actually use your weapons

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.100
in a place like this?

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.940
Why not?

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.060
Is the Bureau

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.300
only for war?

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.480
- But...
- Fighting

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.420
is for peace and protecting

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.380
the people.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.060
The tools I develop now

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.820
also protect them.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980
What's the difference?

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.500
Didn't Wei Jun

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.780
tell you that?

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.460
Seems you're far

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.820
behind your brother.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.220
He may be rigid,

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.660
but not as tense as you.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.660
Also,

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.340
he's much more generous.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.820
Whenever he came here,

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.740
he paid first.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.820
You should be grateful

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.940
I let you pay today.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.660
Stop putting on that sour face.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.180
Since you're close

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.020
with my brother,

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.020
and you understand Great Sui weapons best,

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.380
I'll be direct.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.460
The core trigger technique

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.620
of the octagonal crossbow

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.700
may have leaked to North Qi.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:25.940
They've built some

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.020
identical to ours.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.620
Impossible.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.780
Only Wei Jun

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.620
and I know

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.460
the core.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.060
The crossbow appeared only once

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.180
in a military drill.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.260
Only a few

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.940
top officers

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.220
knew.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.220
And the blueprint

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.540
never left the Arsenal Bureau.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.020
How could it leak?

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.260
Ask yourself, Master Lu.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.540
The recoil is too strong.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.820
Ordinary soldiers can't use it.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:48.980
Ten parts of force and

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.060
you take three parts injury.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.260
That is the octagonal crossbow.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.780
I saw it on the battlefield myself.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.140
This is my design.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.220
And yes,

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.060
it wasn't adopted

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.060
because of that recoil.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.700
Wait, you...

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.340
You're not

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.340
suspecting me, are you?

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.860
Until it's investigated,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.740
everyone in the Arsenal Bureau

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.580
is a suspect.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.620
I'll take this back and examine it.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:27.860
Prove to me

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.820
you're clean.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.340
If you didn't trust me,

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.100
why walk into my trap today?

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.020
When will you have results?

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.700
That depends on you.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.380
When you can catch up to your brother.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.900
Sir.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.140
- Sit down.
- Lord Yun.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.780
- Enjoy.
- That's right.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.940
- Sit down.
- Yes.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.340
Master Lu,

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.820
why so rushed?

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.260
I prepared fine wine

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.100
to treat you.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.300
Stay and taste it.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.980
Come on, try it.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.820
There's actually

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.060
such a beauty in Fragrance House.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.460
No need, no need.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.300
Master Lu, sit.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.660
Drink.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.850
No. No.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.980
Comfortable?

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.460
Is my strength just right?

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.620
Come, let me wipe that.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.460
No need.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.540
Ladies,

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.460
forgive me today,

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.460
this young man is mine now.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.820
Goodbye. Goodbye.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.660
Thanks.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.020
Thank you.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.740
Please.
