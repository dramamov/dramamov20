Thanks.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.840
Thank you.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.480
Please.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.120
What is this, Lady?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.870
You said you'd entertain me,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.920
and now you're off to someone else.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.790
He doesn't pamper you like I do.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.520
Fill it up.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.400
Seems the young lord

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.360
and this lady fancy each other.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.590
Then I'll serve you instead,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.470
Master Lu.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.400
Fine, fine.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.310
Oh, Wei Yun,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.590
I thought you were

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.430
a man who wouldn't be tempted.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.080
Didn't expect

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
you liked this.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.750
Not bad,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.030
better potential

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.750
than Wei Jun.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.870
Young lord,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.080
don't be upset.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.080
Master Lu

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.470
often entertains

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.590
guests here.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.190
We see him a lot.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.190
But you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.750
don't look like a regular.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.470
What important guests

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.520
do you host here, Master Lu?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.150
Just colleagues and friends.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.630
Since I came

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.960
with you today,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.310
you owe me

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.150
a clear answer.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.710
Just now,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.030
I already said,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.030
it depends on your ability.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.750
You want answers?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.470
Get yourself into the Arsenal Bureau first.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.560
Why so nervous?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.120
Keep pouring.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.630
Of course.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.190
I'll make you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.430
feel at home today.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.590
Please.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.960
Come on.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.520
Alright,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.680
you two look close.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.960
I won't

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.190
get in the way.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.480
You haven't told me

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.190
when I can enter the Arsenal Bureau.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.040
Wei Yun,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.430
you think it's easy

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.270
to enter?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.360
Get your title,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.750
earn the tally,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.430
enter as the Marquis,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.590
otherwise

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.040
you'll never walk out again.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.480
Why are you pulling me?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.680
Why are you here?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.920
To help you, of course.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.920
Don't you know

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.000
what kind of place this is?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.430
Of course I do.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.270
I know Mingliu well.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.120
She's helping me.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.040
I can handle it.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.360
Seems you forgot

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.480
you're from the Wei family.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.720
Okay, okay,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.560
I know.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.760
How did you come?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.480
You took the divorce paper,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.120
why go back to the Wei Mansion?

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.240
I just borrowed it.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.080
Take it back.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.070
Is your brother's matter settled?

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.230
Of course.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.400
By the way,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.720
that man earlier,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.000
is he really the Arsenal Bureau's

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.840
master of arms?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.750
Then why did he ask to meet you

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.680
at Fragrance House?

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.800
What were you doing there?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.720
You were really just helping me?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.680
Of course.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.160
I figured it was

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.000
your first time there,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.630
and you might not manage alone.

(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.920
What are you doing now?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.360
My bell won't come off.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.800
It's caught in my hair.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.870
Come help me.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.520
That's

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.510
not proper.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.240
What's improper?

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240
I'm fully dressed.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.120
Hurry.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.960
I...

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.270
Here,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.110
help me.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.000
Here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.840
Right here.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.270
Come on.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.560
Do it now.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.000
Get it off for me

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.040
before someone sees

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.000
and gets suspicious.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.560
It's fine,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.510
you can pull harder.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.030
I'm afraid of hurting you.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.080
Chun.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.080
Yun.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.230
Yu?

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.150
Why did you two

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.630
come back together?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.080
We ran into each other on the road,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.630
so he kindly brought me back.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.630
Is there food?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.840
I'm hungry.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.080
Yes,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.510
I'll have someone make it.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.700
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.630
Yun,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.550
why are you sweating?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.560
What's wrong?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.680
I...

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.750
It's hot today.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.630
Little puppy!

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.320
Where did you come from?

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.240
You're so cute!

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.720
Where's your family?

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.150
All alone?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.840
You're adorable!

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.270
Come, I'll get you something to eat.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.110
Alright?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.110
My Lady.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.320
A puppy?

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.000
Don't scare it.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.510
From now on,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.720
we're a family of three.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.600
So you still

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.960
want a dog.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.240
Of course.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.630
They're so cute.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.510
If Mother hadn't forbidden it,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.840
I'd have kept a whole pack at the Chu home.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.150
My Lady, you seem relaxed.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.510
So Lord Linyang's matter

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.360
is settled?

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.360
Of course.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.720
And I even

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.750
saw Lu Qiba tonight.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.750
If Wei Yun hadn't been watching me,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.480
I'd have said more,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.960
but he ruined it.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.910
So what should

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.080
we do next?

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.360
Next, the most important thing

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.480
is the investiture banquet.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.150
Once Wei Yun successfully inherits his title

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.150
and gains control over

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.120
the Arsenal Bureau,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.630
I'll have the chance

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.550
to get the tally

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.360
and enter.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.900
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.270
I'll hang you up.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.840
Let's see how you disturb me then.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.200
I'll hang you up later.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.920
Commander Lu,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.390
why suddenly examine

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.630
the octagonal crossbow schematics?

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.720
Look at this mechanism.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.630
It's neither from Great Sui

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.750
nor our Arsenal Bureau.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.600
Then where did this mechanism

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.160
(Wei Tongfeng, Arsenal Bureau Director)
come from?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.480
From Wei Yun.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.510
Commander Lu,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.670
with him about to inherit the title,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.150
does this mean our Arsenal Bureau

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.510
will take orders from him?

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.960
Since I lured him

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.150
into the plan at Fragrance House,

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.600
I won't let him

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.840
inherit easily

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.150
or step into our bureau.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.920
Why the rush?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.270
There's a good show coming.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.260
Ladies, which do you prefer?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.490
Have you heard?

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.530
Since returning to the capital,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.390
the Young General Wei Yun

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.870
stays at Fragrance House every night,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.960
with a different companion each time.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.480
How could a loyal Wei family

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.550
raise such a reckless,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.080
shameless son?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.960
Did you hear?

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.600
Last night, Wei Yun

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.480
spent a fortune

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.730
on a dancer

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.840
and even got into a fight.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.740
Of course I heard that.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.360
This rumor has spread

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.670
throughout the city.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.150
Have you heard it?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.150
Yesterday, Wei Yun went to

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.150
Fragrance House for pleasure.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.320
Really?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.360
Such reckless behavior

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.240
in the mourning period?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.280
Indeed.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.320
Have you heard?

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.390
General Wei Yun

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.480
often lingers in brothels.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.240
He would struggle to wield a weapon,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.720
let alone going to the battlefield.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.750
The Wei family is doomed.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.750
Excuse me,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.840
are you talking about

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.080
Wei Yun of the Marquis' house?

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.870
Who else could it be?

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.360
There's only one

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.550
Wei family in Huajing City.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.000
I'd never heard Wei Yun

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
behaved this way.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.240
Could there be

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.270
a misunderstanding?

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.240
What misunderstanding?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
He just hid it well before.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.630
Passing through countless flowers,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.720
one cannot remain untouched.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.000
What we know

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.600
might only be the tip of the iceberg.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.200
Pick me some fresh ones.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.120
Wrap these up.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.150
Sure, no problem.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.440
Jin,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.790
your brother's dismissal just got resolved,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.000
yet people are spreading such rumors.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.320
Someone clearly doesn't

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.960
want our military families at peace.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.080
I truly don't know how your sister

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.720
is faring at the Wei household.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.840
Why don't you

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240
accompany me there now

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.670
to bring Yu home?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.560
Mother,

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.750
Chu Yu severed ties with you

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.720
to marry into the Wei family.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.510
Even with Wei Yun in prison,

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.670
she refused to return.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.360
Even if you went to fetch her,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.630
she wouldn't come with you.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.120
Impossible..

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.030
Yun came home with

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.960
her yesterday.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.000
How could he have gone to Fragrance House?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.120
This rumor isn't baseless.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.360
There must be another motive.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.790
Will this rumor

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.870
affect the inheritance?

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.960
My family is in ruins,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.390
yet I'm said to frequent brothels,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.230
idle,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.080
debauched, immoral.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.870
I can already imagine

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.720
the censors impeaching me.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.870
He was really there?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.200
Yes.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.360
No wonder he arranged to meet there.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.750
He planned this.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.910
Lu Qiba truly is a scoundrel.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.720
But

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.480
most people at Yun's age

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.000
would already be married with children.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.390
It's understandable

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.600
that Yun did that.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.470
Exactly.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.120
He's in the prime of youth after all.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.120
Then Yu,

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.840
this was your mistake.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:01.870
My mistake?

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.480
You shouldn't have hidden it from us,

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.920
letting him go to Fragrance House

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.880
and be tricked.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.000
Even if Yun

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.070
really liked that

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.520
Lu Qiba,

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:11.790
could the Wei family

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.350
not accommodate a dancer?

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.200
Yes.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.040
Chun,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.880
I didn't buy any dancer.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.630
I...

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.240
This is a big misunderstanding.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.200
I can't explain it clearly.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.150
Heavens.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.030
If the investiture fails,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.720
should we still

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.750
hold the banquet?

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.150
Of course.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.840
We cannot let others ridicule us.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.030
Will His Majesty believe

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.110
whatever they say?

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.590
The matter isn't settled yet.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.960
We must stay composed.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.200
Yu,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.640
do you have a solution?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.680
Change all the invitations

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.000
to a "Thanksgiving Banquet,"

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.440
to honor everyone

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.920
who has ever helped the Wei family.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.030
Even on this battlefield,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.550
the Wei family cannot lose.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.150
Thank you.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.200
We hope we can do it.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.790
That said,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.890
he doesn't seem worried at all.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.000
Could it be all bluff?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.440
Could you be silent for a moment

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.630
and let me think?

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.480
Heads may fall, blood may spill,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.860
battles may be fought,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.360
but even if the sky falls,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.750
the Wei family cannot lose its title.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.200
How will outsiders

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.070
see it later?

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.000
Let them think what they will.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.070
Reputation is earned.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.510
I simply don't want to lose to Lu Qiba.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.960
Since he set a challenge,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.510
I'll solve it.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.640
Otherwise, how can I enter the Arsenal Bureau?

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.100
Perhaps you could ask

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.460
the Eldest Princess

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.740
or Grand Tutor Xie

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.020
to speak on our behalf?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.820
The rumors arose because I

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.060
visited the brothel,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.620
hardly something suitable

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.780
to bring before them.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.500
How could I ask them for help?

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.780
My Lady,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.260
look

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.100
what I brought.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.820
It's

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.100
from my brother?

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.940
Did he say anything?

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.780
He said

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.860
he had already inquired about

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.070
the Emperor's intentions.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.900
The Emperor hasn't made a clear decision,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.300
only suggested

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.300
he consider it.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.860
There's still

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.300
room for negotiation.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.220
Go to the Duke of Hu's residence

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.780
and invite Lord Song

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.260
to our home for a meeting.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.380
I'll drag him here if I have to.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.340
Just go.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.620
My Lord.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.220
What is it now?

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.580
Lady Yu is looking for you.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.380
Why have you

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.060
come to me?

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.820
Isn't that mine?

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.260
It's for deterring thieves.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.140
With so many items here,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.620
any thief wouldn't know where to start.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.820
I drafted an invitation.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.780
Since it's for your Thanksgiving Banquet,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.740
you should review them.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.900
Is this a pile of kindling you've drawn?

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.700
Everyone in Huajing City knows

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.100
General Chu's calligraphy is commanding,

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.100
like dragons and tigers.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.260
Your handwriting

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.260
hasn't inherited a fraction of that.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.780
My hands

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.060
won't cooperate.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.140
Whenever I try

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.220
to pick up a book,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.180
they reach for spears and swords instead.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.500
I can't refuse such courtesy.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.860
Chu General never taught you?

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.260
My father

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.820
lets me do

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.860
whatever I like.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.180
My happiness comes first.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.500
What,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.660
you think it's improper too?

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.580
Right?

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.220
Then hurry up and write it.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.300
After all, I am now

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.900
part of the Wei household.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.500
It wouldn't do to show

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.940
sloppy work, right?

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.660
Will Lu Qiba's commotion

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.060
affect your investiture?

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.420
Is there anything else?

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.900
If you have plans,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.900
tell me,

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.340
I might be able to help.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.260
Now that you are First Madam

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.180
of the Wei family,

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.740
my status as Marquis

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.860
does not affect yours.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.340
Why do you care so much

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.580
whether I inherit the title?

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.900
How could it not matter?

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.300
If you inherit,

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.500
my status as the First Madam

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.780
of Wei family rises with it.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.700
Right?

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.020
Why are you here?

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.060
You are

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.900
afraid of dogs?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.500
Of course not.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.740
I'm just worried about hurting it.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.460
Really?

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.860
I didn't expect

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.100
Young General Wei

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.580
to fear a dog.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.940
I'm not afraid.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.140
It just appeared suddenly,

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.700
and I wasn't prepared.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.220
Xiaoqi, you're so adorable,

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.300
how can anyone fear you?

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.020
What do you call it?

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.660
Xiaoqi.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.740
Do you think the name

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.020
suits it perfectly?

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.130
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.220
Not at all.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.100
I tried many names,

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.100
but it only

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.380
liked this one.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.220
Am I right?

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.780
If you don't like it,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.620
perhaps

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.740
you should ask it.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.500
Since you won't speak,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.380
I'll take that as agreement.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.820
This

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.900
is excellent.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.900
Then please write the rest.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.580
I'll have Wanyue pick them up later.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.740
Let's go home.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.140
Come on, Xiaoqi.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:23.260
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.020
A thanksgiving banquet?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.020
Yes.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.020
Thank you for your previous advice

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.460
and speaking for Yun

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.460
in front of His Majesty.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.140
It's to thank

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.500
everyone who

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.940
spoke up for Yun.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.020
We hope

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.340
Your Highness will attend.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.340
(Invitation)

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.860
Besides the banquet,

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.860
you have nothing else to say?

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.660
There is, actually.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.140
I know

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.820
Your Highness has

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.780
many handsome,

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.980
talented followers.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.580
These playing cards

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.580
were made from

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.700
(5 guan)
the portraits

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.700
of the best ten

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.580
among them.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.380
They were made for Your Highness

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.740
as a small

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.020
Thanksgiving gift.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.940
(7 guan)

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.780
Interesting.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.220
I like these cards.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.140
In your spare time, Your Highness

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.260
can use them to pass the hours.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.540
(7 guan)
If you like,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.500
I can make

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.740
other little items as gifts.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.020
You can make other things?

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.100
Of course.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.060
Miniature calendars,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.980
clay figurines,

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.940
fan faces,

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.580
lantern paper,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.420
anything

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.900
Your Highness fancies,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.740
I can make.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.660
You and the cards are charming.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.900
I knew

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:55.940
at Qinxi Valley

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.500
you were clever and knew

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.100
how to please people.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.020
(8 guan)

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.100
Oh, Hanmei,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.140
even his small portrait

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.740
is outstanding.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.020
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.420
Lady Chu, please wait.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.500
Mr. Xue.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.580
Although you did not

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.260
mention the rumors about General Wei,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.500
Her Highness knows

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.980
the investiture

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.780
is of extreme importance to the Wei family.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.580
Moreover,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.060
the gift you brought

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.500
pleased Her Highness greatly,

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.940
so

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.460
she is willing to help you once more.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.460
This silk bundle

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.420
may relieve the Wei family's present worries.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.060
Is this bundle from Her Highness

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.460
or from you, Mr. Xue?

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.980
Why do you ask this?

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.220
Does it

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.340
matter?

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.980
I suppose Her Highness's liking of you

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.540
is not only for your looks.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.340
Then thank you for the bundle

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.580
from both of you.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.580
Will Your Highness

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.060
attend the Wei family's banquet?

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.180
I feel that though it's called "Thanksgiving,"

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.820
it's really about the investiture.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.380
Rumors about the Wei family

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.500
now boil in the city.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.100
Wei Yun's investiture

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.260
is top priority.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.100
He lacks the military success

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:23.980
and reputation to win

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.060
everyone's trust.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.500
The capital's powerful

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.140
are fence-sitters.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.260
And Chu Yu is clever.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.740
She will find a strategist

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.740
to steady the wind

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.300
and fix the outcome.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.900
I have already helped

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.740
Wei Yun once at court.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.700
Why should the Wei family

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.140
expect me to help a second time?

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.460
Then I'll dispose

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.300
the invitation as usual.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.820
Don't rush.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.060
I've already given her a token.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.460
Let's see how she uses it.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.140
Early spring,

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.740
the weather is still cold.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.500
Catch may be poor.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.060
Fishing isn't only about hook and catch.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.140
It's about observing

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.140
where fish gather

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.380
to sharpen one's observation

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.980
and sensitivity.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.780
Based on your observation,

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.140
should I

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.740
go to the banquet

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.980
or not?

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.340
(Invitation)

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.380
Your Highness worries that

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.500
attending

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.260
would openly align you

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.580
with the Marquis of Zhenguo

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.900
and break

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.280
the delicate civil-military balance

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.500
the Emperor has

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.340
barely achieved,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.620
disrupting court order.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.900
You sure have your own read

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.620
on court affairs.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.100
I haven't pondered so deeply.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.700
I simply find

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.260
Lady Chu interesting

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.780
and compatible with Your Highness.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.740
If Your Highness socializes more,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.060
I will be pleased.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:50.980
Coincidentally,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.300
I also find

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.500
Lady Chu interesting.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.860
But was your smile

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.220
for Lady Chu,

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.540
or for me?

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:08.860
Your Highness,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.460
I just returned from the herb fields.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.860
I may have

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.700
some unclean herbs on me.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.180
Medicine heals, right?

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.100
Yes and no,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.580
unsuitable herbs

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.980
can also poison.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.540
Bring me water.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.980
Yes.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.180
Your Highness.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.380
Mr. Xue has served

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.300
by your side ten years.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.660
How could he harm you?

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.860
He wouldn't dare.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.340
But his coldness

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.220
hasn't changed at all.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.100
(Drunken Immortal Tavern)

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.180
You just took office

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.140
and still have time to treat me to a drink?

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:19.420
Speak,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.580
what do you need?

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.180
Recently I've been

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.460
acting as Minister of Justice.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.420
Whenever I meet Vice Minister Song,

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.020
something seems off.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.260
Though from

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.180
Duke of Hu's Mansion,

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.660
he rose by study

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.980
and merit to be

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.420
a vice minister.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.220
After all,

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.420
he's one of many sons

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.860
of the Duke of Hu.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.780
I suspect he bears resentment.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.980
Even if Song is resentful,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.260
with his character,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.860
he shouldn't trouble you.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.700
He hasn't troubled me yet,

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.260
but I need his help

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.020
in doing something.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.260
I want to reopen the Lord of Qin treason case.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.220
(Spring Breeze House)

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.980
Mr. Gu.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.700
Mr. Song.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.060
Minister Gu,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.860
congratulations on your

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.940
promotion to Minister of Justice.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.580
This cup I offer to you,

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.980
and I hope you

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.620
will guide me well in the future.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.740
No vinegar in this wine,

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.220
Mr. Song,

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.980
why does it sound sour?

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.700
Mr. Song,

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.340
the Lord of Qin's treason case

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.260
is crucial for my Gu family.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.340
I've labored to become

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.780
Minister of Justice

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.940
to investigate it.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.660
If it weren't for this,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.740
the title of Minister

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.900
or even top scholar means nothing to me.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.340
Once the truth is clear,

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.780
I will voluntarily resign

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.100
before the Emperor.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.140
Mr. Gu, your talent

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.900
surpasses mine as a top scholar.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.180
Moreover,

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.300
I know why you act

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.140
as you do.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.100
During the Lord of Qin case,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.860
your whole family suffered.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.100
Not only

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.580
did Chancellor Gu

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.740
and Mrs. Gu die,

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.180
but you were exiled

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.140
to the southwest.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.100
Now all of Huajing

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.260
say you married into

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.740
a wealthy household for gain,

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.380
yet I understand

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.100
the heavy responsibility you bear.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.740
Mr. Song, you know me so well.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.420
My suspicions were petty.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.740
Mr. Gu,

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.260
enough bowing.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.420
The dishes will get cold.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.500
It's all because of you

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.580
talking nonsense?

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.940
I see, you're jealous

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.420
because we are better friends.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.860
Mr. Gu,

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.420
please.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.460
I am not jealous of you two.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.860
I only fear that ill feelings

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.940
might grow between you.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.580
Since you

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.420
accuse me,

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.580
today's wine

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.740
is on you.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.220
As you wish.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.420
However,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.740
the Lord of Qin treason case

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.420
is dangerous, people could die.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.020
Mr. Gu,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.700
are you certain you want to investigate?

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.580
How can I not?

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.940
The past is gone,

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.820
but my heart is uneasy.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.100
I have lived

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.940
for this reason.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.820
Even in death,

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.700
I must face my parents

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.780
and my family

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.020
in the afterlife with pride.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.380
It's a pity

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.340
the Lord of Qin,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.820
though born common,

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.700
gained the title by

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.020
unprecedented military merit,

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.100
only to betray Great Sui

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.420
with the Princess Yunyang

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.300
in North Qi,

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.060
a tragic waste of fame.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.660
The Lord of Qin

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.500
did not betray Great Sui.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.860
My words end here.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.700
I act not only for the Gu family's honor,

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.420
but for Great Sui's future.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.580
Gentlemen,

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.660
we have studied for years

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.230
but were born in turbulent times.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.100
We cannot fight in armor.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.780
Should we passively allow others

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.140
to ruin our land?

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.380
We should cling on our fading age!

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.820
Mr. Gu,

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.460
your reminder is timely.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.380
We know Mr. Song

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.780
is from the Duke of Hu's household

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.570
and is talented in both civil

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.940
and military affairs.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.500
Mr. Song,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420
I seek neither power

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.220
nor wealth,

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.420
only the truth

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.020
and peace of mind.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.460
The Lord of Qin case files

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.060
are sealed.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.940
Only we may retrieve them

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.140
in person.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.700
Mr. Gu,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.260
we have known each other for years.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.700
I understand your intent.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.500
Rest assured,

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.620
I will help you.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.500
Thank you.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.660
Yun,

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.700
come on, hurry.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.780
My brother?

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.780
No wonder he left home

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.740
so early.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.940
So he went to meet General Wei.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.620
Wei Yun's Spring Breeze House rumor

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.180
has caused a stir across the city.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.100
All court officials

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.020
are critical.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.540
He surely needs to move about now

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.020
to find a chance.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.620
Is he sure seeking my brother

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.580
is really a good decision?

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.940
I suppose you received the invitation

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.380
to the Wei family's Thanksgiving banquet.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.740
What do you think?

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.660
Are you going?

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.580
(Yuelai Inn)

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.420
Come.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.140
I asked you to lead me to the Crown Prince.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.340
Why

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.220
did you bring me to the inn?

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.180
Are you closer

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.060
to the Crown Prince, or I?

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.300
I said he's here,

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.420
so he must be here.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.580
Let's go.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.900
Wei Yun.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.060
Why are you here?

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.020
The Eldest Princess told me to come.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.140
You...

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.500
Looks like the Crown Prince really is here.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.580
Naturally.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.700
Let's go.
