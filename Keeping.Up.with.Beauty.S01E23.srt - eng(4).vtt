=Episode 23=

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.200
Shiqi's biological father has
told us everything.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.959
The poison that harmed Grandma and you,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.200
and the drug slipped into my wine,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.799
all came from him.
He gave them to Shiqi.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.040
And besides that,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.439
he even handed over some recorded calls.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.799
Shiqi was...

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.920
We have proof and witnesses.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.439
Everyone has to pay
for what they've done.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.959
Are you okay?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.439
Mr. Gu,

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.359
the eye specialist
we contacted from the U.S.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.799
arrived in China.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.079
You can have your surgery soon.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.959
Maybe,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.879
you'll be fully recovered in no time.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.480
Gu Chenyu's eyes will be healed soon.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:03.519
Yunyun,

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.680
it's time for you to do what you must

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.000
and go where you're meant to be.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.120
I...

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.759
Even if you want to stay,

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.000
Fu Zhengkang's death

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.360
will always be between you two.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.680
Don't you still feel guilty

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.840
toward Fu Yunyun?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.759
I understand.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.280
Once his surgery's done,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.639
I'll leave.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.199
I'll get going.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.719
Okay.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
Be safe on your way.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.159
Hello?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.439
Hello.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.719
Is this Ms. Fu Yunyun?

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.560
Yes, speaking.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.159
We're from the Haicheng City
Public Security Bureau, Jiangzhou.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.759
My name's Li.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.199
We have updates

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.039
about your father's death
to confirm with you.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.280
(We found a surveillance video)

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.759
on Gu Shiqi's computer.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.400
It's connected to your father's death
a year ago.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.240
We've already arrested Gu Qingshan.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.360
He's confessed to everything he did.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.520
An officer will be
in touch with you soon.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.840
Please cooperate.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.240
Fu Zhengkang.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.719
What are you doing here again?

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.439
How many times do I have to say it?

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.240
I will never sell the Jiangxing Hotel.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.199
Not even if I die.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520
Don't be so stubborn.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.280
Think about your daughter.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.240
If you die,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.479
all those debts will fall
on Fu Yunyun's shoulders.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.000
Even if you leave her
the Jiangxing Hotel,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.759
she won't be able to keep it.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.279
She'll be at everyone's mercy.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.319
By then,

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.360
Chenyu can buy Jiangxing
at an even cheaper price.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.759
How dare you use Yunyun to threaten me?

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.920
I'll give you one last chance.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.639
The Jiangxing Hotel,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.720
are you selling it or not?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.040
Never!

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.399
Gu Qingshan,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.879
I'd rather die than sell it to you.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.839
You brought this on yourself.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.399
Fu Yunyun,

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.120
your father's death

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.399
can finally be avenged.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.300
(Gu Qingshan was convicted of murder,)

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.020
(extortion, and embezzlement.)

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.900
(He was sentenced to death
for his crimes.)

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.300
(All his personal assets
were confiscated.)

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.279
Have some water.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.639
Don't worry.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.120
The surgery will go smoothly.

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.920
When my eyes are healed,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.480
will you be leaving?

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.480
(Does he already know
I'm not Fu Yunyun?)

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.000
Back then, Third Uncle did what he did

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.920
because of me.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.399
I can't deny my part in it.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.439
But Yunyun,

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.360
I want to try again.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.079
Let's start over.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.079
Give me another chance.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:28.720
Please?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.639
I...

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.240
If you're willing,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920
I hope that...

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.800
when I open my eyes again

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.720
the first person I see...

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.879
is you.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.720
Okay.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.120
I'll think about it.

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:24.680
Mr. Gu,

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.639
we can head to the operating room now.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.639
Please come out safely.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.600
Ms. Fu.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.240
There's something

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.720
I think you should know.

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:08.639
Mr. Gu spent a lot of time and effort

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.480
collecting your paintings

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.000
from different stages of your life.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.560
He even organized
this exhibition just for you.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.160
Actually, that day...

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.879
was supposed to be a surprise for you.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.840
The brushwork is quite delicate.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.799
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.000
Very imaginative.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.460
(Fu Yunyun's Personal
Oil Painting Exhibition)

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:09.919
(There's one more thing.)

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.720
(Mr. Gu asked me to pass this on.)

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.440
Actually, he...

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:16.759
He had already guessed
who you really are.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.799
But he said,

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.919
no matter who you are,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.519
it doesn't matter to him.

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:26.039
(He just wants to spend
the rest of his life with you.)

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:29.000
(Mr. Gu hopes)

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.679
(you can start over in this world,)

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.600
(with a new life,)

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.240
(a new beginning,)

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.840
(free from all burdens and restraints.)

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.120
(From now on,)

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.399
(live freely, follow your heart.)

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.799
What a special exhibition.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:17.590
Though I can't quite tell
what the theme is.

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:19.679
I asked the person in charge.

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:20.600
He said

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.919
this exhibition is a gift.

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:23.720
The name is

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.759
