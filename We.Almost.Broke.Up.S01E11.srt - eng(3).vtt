00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I knew it.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.360
Chen was telling the truth.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.800
Let me ask you something.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.959
- In the future, I...
- You'll join...

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.240
the city's best law firm.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.800
You'll make a lot of money,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.600
but you'll get into stocks later on.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200
I see.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760
Look at you two.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080
Chen has been locking himself
in the dorm lately.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
I don't know what he's doing.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.760
- Why don't you...
- Stop talking about him.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.520
I have nothing to do
with him anymore.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080
Besides,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.320
I finally got a second chance.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.240
I want to live my life
to the fullest.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.839
Miss.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.919
I didn't quite understand...

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.200
what you just said.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.680
Why don't you tell us again?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.999
The most popular item
you're selling...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
will get into trouble tonight.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
Change it before it's too late.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.920
Even if it's mineral water.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.960
Otherwise, your opponent will always
dominate over you.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.480
Why should I believe you?

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160
Ms. Wang.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.560
As long as you trust me,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880
you'll get promoted.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840
(Movie "Ex 3: Farewell, Ex"
Literary Script)

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320
Where did you find her?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.440
She came here herself.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.760
She hasn't even graduated
from college yet.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.880
Is this how your school
train you these days?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.159
Who would dare to send their kids...

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.400
to the school in the future then?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
It's okay.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560
Ms. Wang.

00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:03.040
HR has my contact information.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640
When you're in trouble,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680
remember to contact me.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.880
- Don't mind her. Come on, edit it.
- Okay.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
What are you writing?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480
Let me see.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
(Inside Meng Yun's House)

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.240
You want me to lose over a million
to change a product?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.320
If you don't, you'll lose over
five million.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.280
Yuan is a new live streamer.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.520
Why should I use him?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.160
Everyone will leave you.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720
He's the only one who won't.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.520
Why should I believe you?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.120
Among all the things
I told you before,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.760
which one was wrong?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.160
(Goodbye... The End)

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Five hundred orders.

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.800
Only 500 orders left now.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.119
Everyone's hands are really fast!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.240
Let's continue clicking the shopping
cart at the bottom of the screen.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240
It's sold out?

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400
The orders rapidly increased!

00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:54.359
We have a huge surge of orders!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.239
- Thank you for your support, guys.
- We got 1,000 orders.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.839
There's nothing left.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.999
Thank you to everyone...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.159
who have supported me until now.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.400
Thank you, everyone. Today,
the orders finally surged.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.320
For this script,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.920
I don't want a single penny.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200
What did you say?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200
You heard me right.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.439
I'm investing my fee...

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.240
into this movie.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
Kid,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.000
you're just starting out,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
and you're so arrogant.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.200
If I don't have this confidence,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.040
I wouldn't dare
to come and work with you.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.879
The new director Chen Jia Wen...

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.439
earned 1.9 billion
at the box office...

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.639
with "Ex 3: Farewell, Ex"...

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.240
and won the New Director Award.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.799
Director Chen Jia Wen's new film,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.119
"Ex 4: Early Marriage"...

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.360
has once again become the phenomenal
romance film of the year.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.359
Director Chen won
two major awards...

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.479
for "Ex 5: First Time Father".

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.239
He also revealed
that "Ex 6: Ex-Wife, Don't Go"...

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.600
is in the works.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.439
I must thank everyone...

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.279
for the support and help this year.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.600
Thank you very much...

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.800
Director Chen, congratulations.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200
Long time no see.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.640
- This is...
- Yan.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.359
- Hi. Congratulations.
- Hello.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360
Nice to meet you.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.520
Chen.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840
Look who I brought.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.080
Didn't you say it would
just be the two of us?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.520
Aren't you busy tomorrow?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.840
I thought we can all meet.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.880
Ma.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.440
I'm late...

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320
Ms. Shen.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200
Director Chen.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440
I must thank you.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520
You are...

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520
a major contributor
behind the scenes.

00:07:23.521 --> 00:07:25.640
Without your promotion,
I wouldn't have won.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.480
Don't say that, Director Chen.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.360
It's because your film is good.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.520
It's a classic.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720
Shall we have a drink?

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280
Sure.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520
Chen Jia Wen.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040
Others may not know,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600
but I do.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.600
You're a thief.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.560
I've done worse.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.200
I invested all my money.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.960
An animated movie...

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.400
and a game.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520
Slick.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.760
You're too slick, Chen Jia Wen.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.360
Why didn't I think of that?

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.640
Hello. One more.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.400
Sorry, we're about to close.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.680
It's... getting late.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.640
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.000
I have an early flight tomorrow too.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.160
Let's go then.
