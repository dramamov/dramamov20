00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:18.745
Whoa!

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:20.385
What the fuck are they doing?

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:24.425
Where is the pack leader?

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.345
Take this with you if you wanna live.

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:40.705
Have you ever wondered why

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.945
whenever the lead actress
and the villain fight

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.385
it's always in the bathroom?

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:52.585
What do you want from me?

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:55.905
Three things.

00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:57.945
Just get on with it.

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.825
Firstly, you knew it all along,
didn't you?

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:04.905
That San's been cheating on you with me.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:10.225
Often.

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:15.145
Good, then.

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:17.345
So it'll be easier to talk.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:19.265
He didn't take advantage of me.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:20.745
We just had sex.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:23.225
It was mutual.

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.065
And that's all.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.145
Nothing more.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.745
That's the first thing.

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:34.865
Do you get paid for doing this?

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:43.865
I know

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:47.945
you're not okay
that your boyfriend cheats.

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:50.665
But you can't leave him…

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:54.745
because he pays for your brother's tuition

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:59.545
so that you can have time
for your oh-so-important research.

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:01.665
Am I right?

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:03.785
Cut to the chase, will you?

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:11.425
I'm so sorry for you.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:15.105
That old bastard only gives scholarships
to poor kids who are geniuses…

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:19.265
not to middle-class kids
like your little brother.

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:23.665
So you had to cling to San for support
until your brother graduates.

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:25.025
That's the second thing.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.185
And the third thing is…

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:30.265
the end of the world.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.705
You don't need someone
to pay for his tuition.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:37.745
You don't have to put up with it anymore.

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.865
Cut the shit and tell the truth

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:43.065
or we're all gonna die.

00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:45.505
I don't understand.

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:48.065
What does my private life
have to do with this?

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:52.745
You really don't know?

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:56.265
Why would San go with those PE kids?

00:02:57.785 --> 00:02:59.545
Is he really that generous?

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:03.145
Or is he that nosey?

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:05.785
Hey.

00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:07.265
Are you sure?

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:11.505
Non.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:12.585
Non.

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:14.945
Non!

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:16.705
Bring out the camera!

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:18.105
Hurry!

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:32.225
Hey, Aek.

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:34.745
Damn! Look at that.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:48.465
What are you talking about? What the hell?

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:50.145
What do you mean by that?

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:51.825
You don't have to believe me.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.425
Why don't you go ask them yourself?

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:03.825
I know people like you very well.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:07.065
The only problem you have…

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.705
is that no one finds you important…

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:15.465
so you have to make yourself important.

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:19.425
You can do whatever
the fuck you want to me, Prao.

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:21.425
But not to my brother.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.625
I know how it feels, Ning.

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:32.705
The truth is too cruel to handle.

00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:36.345
But you and I,
we still have long way to go.

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:39.505
Maybe until
the very last second of our lives.

00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:43.745
Do you think I'm saying all this
just to mess with your head?

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:45.585
Think again.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:49.665
I'm saying this
because I know that people like you

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:51.305
would never be a follower.

00:04:52.345 --> 00:04:54.585
One day,
one of you will act like a smart-ass

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:56.385
and make us kill, just like Aek did.

00:04:57.465 --> 00:04:59.585
If you keep pretending
to care for one person

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.545
when really you care for the other…

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.385
the rest of us will just be extras.

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:08.065
And I won't stand it.

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:10.345
If you don't make it clear…

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:12.505
I'll say it myself.

00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.505
Let's start with your brother's tuition.

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:16.425
Stop it!

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:17.345
Why?

00:05:17.425 --> 00:05:18.825
-Where are you going?
-Ning!

00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:21.985
What's the matter?

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:33.105
No, nothing.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:26.905
What are you writing?

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.545
Information about the zombies.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:31.825
What for?

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.105
So we can keep track
of how much we know about them.

00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:42.825
Are you into it?

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.585
Huh?

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.305
I'm talking about zombies.

00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:52.265
Damn.

00:07:54.585 --> 00:07:56.345
Why should I feel guilty about this?

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:00.905
You know what?

00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:04.025
The Walking Dead was my first zombie show.

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:06.185
I was around ten at the time.

00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:08.225
I was really shaking.

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:13.625
And I didn't even blink.

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:17.225
Damn! It was fucking scary.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:19.345
I could only imagine

00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:20.985
if it could really happen…

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:23.905
if I would run around with Thorn
killing zombies.

00:08:23.985 --> 00:08:25.185
It would be fun.

00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:28.105
And I kept liking it more.

00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.985
And even more, and a lot more.

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:32.784
I watched all the zombie movies.

00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:35.664
Started with Night of the Living Dead,
directed by Romero.

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:38.225
I just watched the movies
even if they were bad.

00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:40.865
When I saw them…

00:08:41.505 --> 00:08:44.985
I felt like I was addicted.

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:47.785
I wanted to be that good,
make movies like that.

00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:50.025
I wanted to have my own zombies. I'm like…

00:08:56.065 --> 00:08:58.385
Damn it.

00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.385
Because it's so wrong in this situation,

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:03.505
I'm sitting here wondering
what will happen to me.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:08.185
If I say that I really like zombies
so damn much!

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:22.745
Oh.

00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:24.185
I'll go check on…

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:28.545
Yeah, go ahead.

00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:41.425
That's so fucked up.

00:09:57.905 --> 00:10:00.625
Damn it! Let's go. Move!

00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.385
Wait for me!

00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:17.025
Hey!

00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:20.705
Are you okay?

00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:21.905
Pao just left!

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.585
-Go after him!
-Pao!

00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:01.185
Are they coming back?

00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:02.105
No.

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:04.025
I don't think so.

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:17.705
Aek, look at that.

00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:20.105
Over there.

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:23.385
The pack leader.

00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:54.505
Why did he become like that?

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:57.865
Pao.

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:02.225
Damn it!

00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:14.385
-Gus!
-Bro!

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:20.985
Look at that!

00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:42.065
Shit!

00:12:50.985 --> 00:12:53.265
Pao! I'll kill you!

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:55.265
Let go of me!

00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:56.345
Back off!

00:12:58.585 --> 00:13:00.825
Jean! Earth is going to kill Pao.

00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:02.665
Stay here!

00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:03.665
Wait, wait!

00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:05.025
Don't go, Mook.

00:13:06.705 --> 00:13:07.985
Mook, calm down!

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:11.945
Is that aunty a pack leader?

00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:16.345
How would I know? I just saw it, too.

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:34.945
What are they doing?

00:13:35.465 --> 00:13:37.265
Are they bringing the food to Aunty?

00:14:40.265 --> 00:14:41.545
Damn it.

00:14:42.505 --> 00:14:44.105
They swarm around it and eat it.

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:46.705
Everyone!

00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:48.585
Everyone, I'm here!

00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:52.065
Everyone, I'm right here!
Come and take me!

00:15:53.825 --> 00:15:58.465
Everyone! I'm right here! Hey! Everyone!

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:00.625
Did you all hear that?

00:16:01.145 --> 00:16:02.345
Is that one of us?

00:16:02.425 --> 00:16:03.705
How can that be one of us?

00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:05.145
Go ahead. Keep recording it.

00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:11.785
Come and take me.

00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:15.785
Take me with you!

00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:28.185
Pao! Son of a bitch!

00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:32.265
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:16:32.345 --> 00:16:33.585
Let go of me!

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:40.785
Pao! Pao!

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:43.625
Back off!

00:16:44.305 --> 00:16:45.505
Let go of me!

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:48.145
Shit!

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.225
Go!

00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:53.145
Go!

00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:54.065
Hurry!

00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:55.345
Faster! Hurry up!

00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:17.704
Damn it! Earth!

00:17:17.785 --> 00:17:19.825
-Korn!
-Hey!

00:17:34.025 --> 00:17:35.225
Damn!

00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:38.825
What's wrong?

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.905
Put the gun down!

00:17:44.065 --> 00:17:45.665
What the hell are you doing?

00:17:45.745 --> 00:17:46.865
Fuck you, bastard!

00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:49.705
Jean!

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:50.825
-Leave me!
-Pao!

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:54.385
I'll kill him!

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:55.705
I will kill him!

00:17:57.545 --> 00:17:58.545
We gotta go!

00:17:58.625 --> 00:17:59.625
-Hurry!
-Pao!

00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:02.745
Are you okay?

00:18:06.025 --> 00:18:06.905
Help me.

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.105
Let's go now!

00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:13.585
Pao, go!

00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:17.585
They're coming!

00:18:18.345 --> 00:18:19.425
Give me the gun!

00:18:24.185 --> 00:18:25.985
Fuck! Fuck it!

00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:38.865
Let go of me!

00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:45.985
-Aek!
-What are you waiting for?

00:18:46.065 --> 00:18:47.185
Run away!

00:18:47.505 --> 00:18:48.865
I said go now!

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:50.945
Let's go!

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:52.065
I said run away!

00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:04.345
Hey!

00:19:06.665 --> 00:19:07.625
Come on!

00:19:11.305 --> 00:19:12.345
-Go!
-I'm not leaving.

00:19:12.425 --> 00:19:13.585
They're coming!

00:19:19.305 --> 00:19:21.065
Shit. Let's go now!

00:19:21.145 --> 00:19:22.185
Hurry up!

00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:32.025
Go now!

00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:35.025
No!

00:19:35.105 --> 00:19:35.945
Now!

00:19:36.025 --> 00:19:36.905
Korn!

00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:40.385
I said run away!

00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:42.905
Let me go! I'll go save him!

00:19:54.265 --> 00:19:55.385
Korn!

00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:56.505
Hurry!

00:19:56.865 --> 00:19:57.825
Faster!

00:19:58.025 --> 00:19:59.705
-Go!
-Take him to the building!

00:20:00.345 --> 00:20:02.545
-I'll go save Aek!
-No, Jean!

00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:03.985
Go! Now!

00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:30.305
Aek! Snap out of it! We need to leave!

00:20:42.425 --> 00:20:43.585
What the hell is that?

00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:47.345
Aek! Move!

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:49.625
Go!

00:20:50.865 --> 00:20:52.025
Pao, stay with me!

00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:55.665
-Take a step!
-Let's go!

00:20:58.465 --> 00:20:59.825
We're getting there!

00:21:01.265 --> 00:21:03.665
Jean! Hurry! Gosh!

00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:06.225
Pao! Stand up! We're so close!

00:21:07.705 --> 00:21:08.825
Come on.

00:21:11.745 --> 00:21:13.905
Let's hide
inside the innovation laboratory!

00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:21.665
Come inside.

00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:34.385
Jean.

00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:36.785
Hey, the generator is still working.

00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:39.065
We can hide in here for a while.

00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:19.425
Ning.

00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:24.585
Aek got bitten!

00:22:25.825 --> 00:22:26.705
Aek…

00:22:26.905 --> 00:22:28.065
Don't come closer.

00:22:29.825 --> 00:22:31.345
I'm not going to survive this.

00:22:38.585 --> 00:22:41.665
I told you! This son of a bitch
will get us all killed!

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:43.865
Pao! Shut up!

00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:49.025
Ning, open the door.

00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:53.185
Now!

00:23:04.025 --> 00:23:05.025
Jean.

00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:07.465
You know how to use the gun?

00:23:11.545 --> 00:23:13.025
All the bullets are in there.

00:23:16.545 --> 00:23:17.825
What are you doing?

00:23:20.985 --> 00:23:22.185
Aek!

00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:27.465
Pao!

00:23:31.265 --> 00:23:32.265
Don't die.

00:23:40.025 --> 00:23:41.025
Pao!

00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:49.465
Pao!

00:23:58.865 --> 00:23:59.865
It's all set.

00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:07.225
1 MONTH EARLIER

00:24:07.305 --> 00:24:08.705
Watch out for your symptoms.

00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:13.185
If there's anything abnormal,
come and see me right away.

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.705
Yes, Professor.

00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:38.105
Jit, remember,
you're not allowed to see a doctor

00:24:38.705 --> 00:24:40.305
or take any medicine on your own.

00:24:44.825 --> 00:24:46.305
Call the next person in.

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:47.625
Well, I'll be going.

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:02.225
The next person can go in.

00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:04.425
They really give the money right away?

00:25:04.505 --> 00:25:05.505
Yeah.

00:25:19.865 --> 00:25:20.985
That's all?

00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:23.145
There'll be more soon.

00:25:25.785 --> 00:25:26.785
Got it.

00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:46.345
Keng.

00:25:48.585 --> 00:25:49.585
Keng.

00:26:41.825 --> 00:26:43.105
Let me sit with you.

00:26:56.065 --> 00:26:58.225
Hello. Please go.

00:27:40.465 --> 00:27:41.465
Aunty.

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:47.825
Why is your face so pale?

00:27:48.185 --> 00:27:49.905
And why are you sweating like that?

00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:52.265
Yeah. I'm confused, too.

00:27:52.345 --> 00:27:54.665
I used to walk these stairs daily
without tiring.

00:27:54.745 --> 00:27:56.185
Let me help you.

00:27:56.265 --> 00:27:58.385
No, no worries.

00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:01.625
I'm fine. I'll be better soon.

00:28:01.705 --> 00:28:05.425
Aunty, these days
the heat waves are really strong.

00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:07.785
You need to take good care of yourself.

00:28:08.145 --> 00:28:12.425
Right, the world we live in
isn't normal anymore.

00:28:14.065 --> 00:28:15.385
And what's all of this?

00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:18.025
You didn't go home last night?

00:28:19.225 --> 00:28:20.625
I have things to finish.

00:28:20.705 --> 00:28:23.625
I'll go take a shower
and get back to monitoring the exam.

00:28:23.705 --> 00:28:25.185
Oh.

00:28:25.265 --> 00:28:28.705
With this kind of hard work,
you'll be rich soon.

00:28:28.785 --> 00:28:30.065
I hope so.

00:28:32.665 --> 00:28:34.145
Hang in there.

00:28:34.225 --> 00:28:36.825
You're in your fourth year.
You're getting there.

00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:39.425
I've been holding it together.
Aunty, I'm dying.

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:42.465
You will survive. You've done a good job.

00:28:46.985 --> 00:28:49.105
Once you graduate, don't forget me.

00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:51.225
Come back and visit sometimes.

00:28:51.505 --> 00:28:53.905
Don't worry about it.

00:28:53.985 --> 00:28:56.425
I still owe most
of my Patron's scholarship.

00:28:56.505 --> 00:28:58.825
I'll keep visiting you
until you get sick of me.

00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:02.625
All right then.
You should leave. Don't be late.

00:29:02.705 --> 00:29:03.905
Go now.

00:29:04.665 --> 00:29:05.865
I'll go then.

00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:08.905
If this is too exhausting,
just use the elevator.

00:29:08.985 --> 00:29:10.465
Don't give a shit about them.

00:29:10.545 --> 00:29:11.745
Gosh!

00:29:11.825 --> 00:29:15.545
You're the protagonist, yet you're using
swear words. Just go already!

00:29:15.625 --> 00:29:17.665
Aunty, use the elevator!

00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:19.145
All right! Just go now.

00:30:08.025 --> 00:30:10.865
MONDAY 17 APRIL

00:30:10.985 --> 00:30:13.665
KENG
MOM, CAN YOU TRANSFER 1,000 THB TO ME?

00:30:42.105 --> 00:30:44.025
Open the door!

00:30:46.305 --> 00:30:47.545
They're coming!

00:30:59.545 --> 00:31:00.625
Hurry up!

00:31:30.345 --> 00:31:31.545
I'm here with you.

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:35.065
I'll be here with you.

00:31:42.265 --> 00:31:44.065
Why is everything like this?

00:32:10.545 --> 00:32:11.745
Answer me.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:15.345
Answer what?

00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:18.785
What did you and Wiroj
do in this laboratory?

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:23.625
Jean…

00:32:25.105 --> 00:32:26.345
What do you think I did?

00:32:31.065 --> 00:32:34.385
This whole thing is about the medicine
for your mother, isn't it?

00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:46.825
Are the doors all locked?

00:32:47.185 --> 00:32:49.545
I don't know how else they can get in.

00:32:49.945 --> 00:32:51.265
We have to stay quiet.

00:32:51.785 --> 00:32:54.105
They're definitely coming for us soon.

00:32:55.745 --> 00:32:57.265
Hey, you.

00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:01.265
Is there any way they can get in here?

00:33:04.785 --> 00:33:06.825
Say something. Why the hell are you quiet?

00:33:11.465 --> 00:33:13.865
Son of a bitch! Say it!

00:33:13.945 --> 00:33:16.265
-Why are you quiet?
-San, calm down.

00:33:16.345 --> 00:33:17.705
-Say something!
-San.

00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:20.785
Speak up!

00:33:23.425 --> 00:33:24.785
We already lost.

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:30.545
We won't survive this.

00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:34.145
And it's because of you.

00:33:40.665 --> 00:33:42.345
What makes you think that?

00:33:42.825 --> 00:33:44.385
Tell me the truth.

00:33:45.785 --> 00:33:47.025
Where is this coming from?

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:51.705
I felt something was off
since you told me.

00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:52.905
In the end,

00:33:52.985 --> 00:33:56.665
you and Wiroj are going
to have to test the drug on people.

00:33:58.465 --> 00:34:01.745
But since this project is confidential,
where will you find people?

00:34:02.105 --> 00:34:04.825
And your mother's disease,
that's also a secret.

00:34:04.905 --> 00:34:05.905
Jean…

00:34:07.065 --> 00:34:09.385
The drug Wiroj and I made
was just an experiment.

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:11.824
Why did you bring people into the lab?

00:34:13.665 --> 00:34:14.505
Huh?

00:34:16.945 --> 00:34:20.425
I saw him bring ten people
over to the lab at night.

00:34:20.505 --> 00:34:23.744
-Do you know nothing about it?
-Wait, over ten people?

00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:27.025
Who did he bring to the lab?

00:34:27.105 --> 00:34:28.865
Toom, Sak,

00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:30.344
-Aunty Jit.
-Stop it!

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:32.784
When did you see this?

00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:34.824
Why?

00:34:34.905 --> 00:34:37.105
When did you see it?
Did you see it yourself?

00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:38.425
Yes.

00:34:39.824 --> 00:34:40.705
When was it?

00:34:41.505 --> 00:34:42.385
A month ago.

00:34:51.025 --> 00:34:52.105
Ning!

00:35:11.225 --> 00:35:17.505
Jellyfish are invertebrates that have
existed on Earth for 500 million years.

00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:20.265
They are one
of the most fascinating creatures

00:35:21.145 --> 00:35:25.465
because they cannot swim
against the current.

00:35:25.545 --> 00:35:28.145
This kind of creature
is what we call plankton.

00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:35.105
And because
they can't swim against the current…

00:35:35.985 --> 00:35:39.025
Then, it shows the distribution
of different plankton species…

00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:41.105
Listen to him, focus on the class.

00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:44.625
…depends on the direction
of ocean currents.

00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:45.785
And of course,

00:35:46.385 --> 00:35:50.425
the direction of ocean currents is one
of the consequences of climate change.

00:35:50.505 --> 00:35:56.465
That means climate change has altered
the direction and speed of ocean currents.

00:35:57.345 --> 00:35:58.905
As a result,

00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:02.305
the distribution of various
jellyfish species will also shift.

00:36:15.105 --> 00:36:16.105
Not long ago…

00:36:17.865 --> 00:36:21.705
there was a report about the discovery
of an immortal jellyfish in Thai waters.

00:36:22.345 --> 00:36:23.785
Did anyone hear this news?

00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.025
Have you heard about it?

00:36:27.505 --> 00:36:30.945
This immortal jellyfish
is very fascinating

00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:35.465
because its body can produce
a certain group of chemicals

00:36:36.505 --> 00:36:38.585
that prevent its cells from deteriorating.

00:36:40.265 --> 00:36:43.745
Scientists are currently
trying to find answers about it.

00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:49.065
And marine biologists
are conducting research on this.

00:36:50.225 --> 00:36:53.505
If any of you has read older papers,
you would know that

00:36:53.905 --> 00:36:58.065
a protein called telomerase had previously

00:36:58.145 --> 00:37:01.345
been found in other jellyfish species.

00:37:02.425 --> 00:37:03.945
This protein helps prevent…

00:37:04.945 --> 00:37:09.225
its DNA from shortening
during cell division.

00:37:11.665 --> 00:37:18.385
But in that immortal jellyfish,
marine biologists seem to have discovered

00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:22.985
certain substances
that can reset cellular functions.

00:37:24.065 --> 00:37:25.545
That substance is called

00:37:26.145 --> 00:37:28.505
-reprogramming fact--
-Reprogramming factor.

00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:42.185
You are not a TA in this subject.

00:37:42.265 --> 00:37:43.385
Why are you here?

00:37:46.145 --> 00:37:49.465
-I'm sorry but I couldn't contact you.
-Go wait for me outside.

00:37:52.225 --> 00:37:53.225
Okay.

00:38:03.945 --> 00:38:05.385
Where were we?

00:38:18.585 --> 00:38:19.545
Professor.

00:38:23.305 --> 00:38:24.585
I have a meeting.

00:38:25.505 --> 00:38:27.865
Wait a second. Are you avoiding me?

00:38:28.865 --> 00:38:30.385
Why would I do that, Ning?

00:38:30.465 --> 00:38:31.385
I have no idea,

00:38:31.465 --> 00:38:34.905
but the jellyfish compound
could reset my mother's cells.

00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:37.305
We could extract
and apply it to the cells…

00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:38.225
Ning.

00:38:38.305 --> 00:38:42.665
…to see if it restores my mother's cells.

00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:45.985
Do you know where to find
the immortal jellyfish?

00:38:46.065 --> 00:38:48.585
Ning, now is not the time.

00:38:50.305 --> 00:38:51.665
When is the right time?

00:38:52.265 --> 00:38:53.225
Not here.

00:38:54.945 --> 00:38:56.305
What is wrong with you?

00:38:56.865 --> 00:38:59.185
Is this why my lab card is not working?

00:39:08.745 --> 00:39:13.025
Right now,
I've got some trouble with the sponsor.

00:39:14.025 --> 00:39:15.825
So I need to put your work on hold.

00:39:16.265 --> 00:39:18.305
Once everything is better, you'll be back.

00:39:18.585 --> 00:39:21.705
Put my work on hold?
Can it really be paused?

00:39:21.785 --> 00:39:23.425
-My mother's life?
-Ning,

00:39:23.505 --> 00:39:26.505
if you don't trust me,
we can't work together.

00:39:28.145 --> 00:39:29.865
I only paused your lab work,

00:39:30.705 --> 00:39:32.705
but out there,
I have no right to stop you.

00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:33.905
You got it?

00:39:39.465 --> 00:39:42.305
Once everything's sorted out,
I'll contact you.

00:40:31.945 --> 00:40:34.745
Turritopsis… rubra?

00:40:58.225 --> 00:41:01.345
A little high blood pressure, Jit,
but there's nothing else.

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:03.265
Am I allergic to the medicine?

00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:07.985
I'll need to run some blood tests.

00:41:08.865 --> 00:41:11.745
If there's even
a single sign of abnormality…

00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:14.145
I'll stop it immediately.

00:41:16.025 --> 00:41:19.305
And are there any other symptoms?

00:41:20.825 --> 00:41:22.225
No.

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:30.065
Did you get some sleep?

00:41:31.065 --> 00:41:32.625
Not really.

00:41:33.225 --> 00:41:34.105
How many days?

00:41:35.345 --> 00:41:36.825
Like three days.

00:41:36.905 --> 00:41:38.145
You can't do that.

00:41:40.065 --> 00:41:41.745
You need to get some rest.

00:41:41.825 --> 00:41:43.385
Take a long leave of absence.

00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:45.585
Otherwise, you'll wear yourself out.

00:41:46.585 --> 00:41:48.465
A medical certification is required.

00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:51.585
But as we know, I can't go to a doctor.

00:41:58.585 --> 00:42:02.105
Will your pay be deducted
if you don't have a medical certificate?

00:42:05.025 --> 00:42:06.825
If so, how much would you want?

00:42:08.465 --> 00:42:09.865
I mean…

00:42:11.545 --> 00:42:13.985
the amount that won't
cause you any problems later.

00:42:24.825 --> 00:42:25.865
Give me your arm.

00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:33.945
You do realize…

00:42:34.905 --> 00:42:38.185
that the document you signed
carries legal weight, don't you?

00:42:39.585 --> 00:42:41.385
If one day you collapse…

00:42:42.905 --> 00:42:44.785
and someone takes you to a hospital…

00:42:45.985 --> 00:42:48.905
and they detect our serum in your system…

00:42:50.185 --> 00:42:52.505
that would mean
you've disclosed our secret.

00:42:54.265 --> 00:42:56.825
The project owner
can take legal action against you.

00:42:57.385 --> 00:42:59.185
That could land you in prison.

00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:08.905
Well, is it possible for me

00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:12.625
to request the remaining installment now?

00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:16.105
That way, I won't inconvenience you.

00:43:22.145 --> 00:43:23.225
I'll take it off.

00:44:54.865 --> 00:44:55.985
Where have you been?

00:44:56.065 --> 00:44:57.585
It's almost morning.

00:44:59.505 --> 00:45:00.745
I went to film the movie.

00:45:03.985 --> 00:45:05.985
What movie wears you out like this?

00:45:09.785 --> 00:45:10.745
Non.

00:45:11.825 --> 00:45:12.705
Non!

00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:14.265
Non!

00:45:18.225 --> 00:45:19.145
What now?

00:45:19.225 --> 00:45:22.625
Just because Mom's sick doesn't
mean you can get away with anything.

00:45:25.945 --> 00:45:27.465
And you're so perfect.

00:45:30.505 --> 00:45:32.345
Mom must be so proud of you.

00:45:33.545 --> 00:45:34.665
Mom's smart one.

00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:37.545
Don't start.

00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:40.385
Don't act like the victim.

00:45:40.865 --> 00:45:42.745
Your life isn't that difficult.

00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:47.825
Yeah, right.

00:45:51.025 --> 00:45:53.225
You and Mom got rid of all the problems.

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:57.385
I never got to know a damn thing.

00:45:59.745 --> 00:46:02.025
You never let me know what was going on.

00:46:05.025 --> 00:46:06.305
Great job.

00:46:08.305 --> 00:46:09.585
Mom's smart one.

00:46:12.345 --> 00:46:13.465
Go to your room.

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:22.745
Mom's favorite kid.

00:47:41.025 --> 00:47:42.145
Myxozoa?

00:47:49.745 --> 00:47:55.105
JITTRA - HEMATOLOGY

00:49:24.265 --> 00:49:25.745
It's just like I thought.

00:49:28.505 --> 00:49:30.345
He used them to make the serum.

00:49:31.585 --> 00:49:32.625
What was it?

00:49:34.345 --> 00:49:35.505
Jellyfish?

00:49:42.105 --> 00:49:44.505
No, they're not.

00:49:46.145 --> 00:49:47.625
But they're infected jellyfish.

00:50:08.825 --> 00:50:09.945
Shit!

00:50:10.025 --> 00:50:11.305
Damn it!

00:50:17.545 --> 00:50:18.385
Lily!

00:50:18.465 --> 00:50:19.465
Lily! Take it easy!

00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:20.505
It's me, Win!

00:50:28.585 --> 00:50:32.065
-Get out of my way!
-No! Don't do it! Stop!

00:50:32.145 --> 00:50:34.185
-What are you doing?
-What the fuck?

00:50:34.265 --> 00:50:35.905
-I'm gonna kill it!
-What the fuck?

00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:39.185
She is not human anymore!
She is a zombie. Let me go.

00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:41.025
-Get off my way!
-Put it down!

00:50:43.825 --> 00:50:44.905
Fuck.

00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:49.985
Damn it.

00:50:51.705 --> 00:50:52.585
Crouch!

00:50:52.665 --> 00:50:53.745
Down on the floor!

00:50:57.705 --> 00:50:58.905
What should we do?

00:50:58.985 --> 00:51:00.025
It's roaring louder!

00:51:01.065 --> 00:51:02.545
Didn't I tell you to kill it?

00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:04.745
Stop it! Toto!

00:51:04.825 --> 00:51:05.825
She is not a human.

00:51:05.905 --> 00:51:06.865
Night.

00:51:08.585 --> 00:51:09.425
The mushroom.

00:51:09.785 --> 00:51:11.785
The mushroom. The mushroom.

00:51:14.225 --> 00:51:15.225
What mushroom?

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.385
Mushroom?

00:51:17.625 --> 00:51:19.185
Everyone! I need your help!

00:51:20.665 --> 00:51:21.785
Help with what?

00:51:22.385 --> 00:51:23.545
What kind of help?

00:51:24.225 --> 00:51:25.265
What help?

00:51:46.705 --> 00:51:47.785
What have you done?

00:52:13.425 --> 00:52:14.705
It really works.

00:52:15.345 --> 00:52:17.505
The magic mushrooms
can calm the zombies down.

00:52:18.185 --> 00:52:20.025
That's not what I'd call calming.

00:52:26.745 --> 00:52:29.665
We can't shove mushrooms
down every zombie's throat, Night.

00:52:30.585 --> 00:52:33.105
It works ten times faster than usual.

00:52:33.985 --> 00:52:35.105
That means…

00:52:35.865 --> 00:52:39.505
psilocybe has a significant effect
on their brains.

00:52:42.065 --> 00:52:43.105
Sun.

00:52:43.385 --> 00:52:44.425
What?

00:52:44.505 --> 00:52:45.785
Can I go out there?

00:52:46.665 --> 00:52:49.145
That gunshots might be
from my brother's group.

00:52:49.225 --> 00:52:50.145
No.

00:52:50.345 --> 00:52:52.545
Why risk it?
If you leave, you'll get killed!

00:52:52.625 --> 00:52:54.425
But here, it's like I'm already dead.

00:52:55.265 --> 00:52:57.065
How long will you stay with that?

00:52:57.145 --> 00:52:58.185
"That"?

00:52:58.265 --> 00:53:00.025
She is your mentor! How dare you?

00:53:03.905 --> 00:53:04.745
Gun…

00:53:05.225 --> 00:53:06.345
Yeah! A gun!

00:53:06.465 --> 00:53:07.305
Gun.

00:53:07.385 --> 00:53:08.265
Gun.

00:53:08.345 --> 00:53:09.265
Hey.

00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:13.305
Stop!

00:53:15.065 --> 00:53:16.145
Sit down.

00:53:16.225 --> 00:53:17.865
The two of you are going nowhere!

00:53:18.505 --> 00:53:19.545
Sit down.

00:53:23.505 --> 00:53:25.225
And what are we gonna do next?

00:53:25.305 --> 00:53:27.385
What are we going to do
once she sobers up?

00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:28.945
Keep giving her mushrooms?

00:53:29.025 --> 00:53:31.905
-What if we ran out of the mushroom?
-We can't just kill her.

00:53:32.465 --> 00:53:33.945
Lily is still inside that body.

00:53:35.785 --> 00:53:37.305
You don't have to believe me.

00:53:37.865 --> 00:53:40.385
But look at her!
She is still a human being.

00:53:40.465 --> 00:53:41.865
Can you really kill her?

00:53:41.945 --> 00:53:43.905
That's a zombie. Can't you see?

00:53:43.985 --> 00:53:45.745
Can you stop calling her a zombie?

00:53:47.705 --> 00:53:50.105
-That's a human!
-We can also call her "that"!

00:53:51.345 --> 00:53:52.265
That's a fact.

00:53:54.185 --> 00:53:56.865
We were taught
what a zombie's supposed to be.

00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:03.985
We're not really afraid of what they are.

00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:07.585
We're afraid of the image we remember.

00:54:11.225 --> 00:54:14.065
What are you talking about?
Do you think that was cool?

00:54:17.465 --> 00:54:18.745
Just leave. All of you.

00:54:19.465 --> 00:54:20.585
I'll be here with her.

00:54:21.345 --> 00:54:23.465
What now? Another one acting up?

00:54:24.705 --> 00:54:25.785
I don't trust you.

00:54:27.265 --> 00:54:29.225
If she's with you, you'll kill her.

00:54:29.305 --> 00:54:32.025
-You knew she couldn't swim!
-What should he have done?

00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:33.465
Go kiss her or something?

00:54:33.545 --> 00:54:34.785
Shut up, freshman!

00:54:35.625 --> 00:54:38.305
What "freshman"? It's over.

00:54:38.385 --> 00:54:39.825
We're all going to die.

00:54:39.905 --> 00:54:40.945
Sun!

00:54:41.585 --> 00:54:43.305
I think you're biased towards Win.

00:54:43.745 --> 00:54:44.665
What biased?

00:54:44.985 --> 00:54:48.105
Remember when Win quit
during the university event

00:54:48.945 --> 00:54:52.305
and called the cops on you
for going overboard,

00:54:52.385 --> 00:54:54.785
and the junior ended up
in a hospital from shock?

00:54:54.865 --> 00:54:55.745
Huh?

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:56.865
Is that true?

00:55:00.265 --> 00:55:02.785
That's why you love Lily.
She's the one you had left.

00:55:03.545 --> 00:55:05.545
Others will never be enough for you!

00:55:10.425 --> 00:55:11.505
That's right.

00:55:11.985 --> 00:55:13.065
Be careful.

00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:15.345
He'll use reverse psychology.

00:55:24.585 --> 00:55:25.705
I admit it.

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:30.545
I don't love you all equally.

00:55:33.065 --> 00:55:34.705
The day she found out that…

00:55:36.305 --> 00:55:38.065
her father had another family…

00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:41.905
that she and her mom
were just the second home…

00:55:42.745 --> 00:55:44.745
Do you guys even know what happened?

00:55:47.465 --> 00:55:50.545
She begged me to teach her
the cheer dance every single day…

00:55:51.505 --> 00:55:52.985
because she was afraid…

00:55:54.105 --> 00:55:55.585
that she might kill herself.

00:56:03.265 --> 00:56:05.985
I stayed with her every night
for almost two months.

00:56:09.185 --> 00:56:10.625
She kept falling down.

00:56:11.665 --> 00:56:14.305
But she kept doing it
no matter how tired she was.

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.505
I told her to stop, I told her to pause.

00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:20.105
But she just said she would keep going.

00:56:21.865 --> 00:56:23.025
Because she knew…

00:56:25.025 --> 00:56:28.545
that practicing cheerleading
was the only thing that kept her alive!

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:32.105
How could I let her die like this?
I just can't let it happen.

00:56:37.065 --> 00:56:38.985
When she started to dance…

00:56:40.705 --> 00:56:42.465
everyone said the same thing.

00:56:43.745 --> 00:56:46.065
That she's the best cheerleader
of Kiatpipat!

00:56:46.145 --> 00:56:48.625
She's the best one we've seen in 30 years!

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:50.545
She's better than me, her trainer!

00:56:53.545 --> 00:56:54.985
It's not talent.

00:56:59.465 --> 00:57:00.825
She's just a girl.

00:57:03.465 --> 00:57:05.265
She was betrayed by her own father.

00:57:09.905 --> 00:57:11.785
She just wants to get there…

00:57:14.665 --> 00:57:17.865
to show everyone
she's worth more than she thinks!

00:57:27.385 --> 00:57:28.625
Are you done?

00:57:30.385 --> 00:57:32.425
Did it take you long
to make up this story?

00:57:33.465 --> 00:57:34.425
Sun…

00:57:35.145 --> 00:57:37.145
You can't expect us to be like Lily.

00:57:37.785 --> 00:57:39.905
We didn't have the same dramatic life.

00:57:46.665 --> 00:57:48.665
Believe whatever you want to believe.

00:57:52.305 --> 00:57:53.745
I have no power left.

00:58:00.145 --> 00:58:02.265
I only have my story with Lily left.

00:58:04.705 --> 00:58:06.785
And that cheerleading dance routine!

00:58:23.665 --> 00:58:25.305
But I want to try something.

00:58:27.105 --> 00:58:28.305
If it doesn't work…

00:58:31.865 --> 00:58:33.185
you can just leave me.
