00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.459
If you move again,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.420
I won't hesitate to whip you even more.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.100
(His scent.)

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.140
(It's him.)

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.900
(He killed those people.)

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.180
I want to see His Majesty.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.220
His Majesty?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.540
You are so naive.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.179
The evidence is conclusive.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.259
Tomorrow morning,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.459
His Majesty will publicly announce
your death sentence

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.419
in front of everyone.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.300
I didn't kill them!

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.500
His Majesty will believe my innocence.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.380
Fox demon.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.020
Do you think His Majesty is still
under your Charm Spell?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.579
(The Charm Spell has been broken.)

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.140
No wonder my brother
never believed what I said.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.660
It turns out you cast
the Charm Spell on him.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.820
Your Lordship.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.300
I have already lifted
the demon's Charm Spell on His Majesty.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.220
That's good to hear.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.140
Now,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.820
he won't blame me

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.100
no matter how much I torture her.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.540
What are you planning to do to me?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.820
Recently,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.700
I've been studying Gu poisons.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.820
I discovered a certain insect

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.300
that loves to suck demon blood.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.059
Once the blood is drained,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.980
it starts feasting on the bone marrow.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.620
In a moment,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.020
I'll smear this honey

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.300
all over you.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.220
The insects will crawl

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.700
up your legs, bit by bit,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580
covering your wounds entirely.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.220
But don't move a muscle.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.699
If you shake them off,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.100
even more will come

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.180
until you're covered

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.740
from head to toe.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.819
Xiling Xuan,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.379
how cruel can you be?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.180
Cruel?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.179
My brother was far crueler

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.219
when he cut into my flesh

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.180
under your influence!

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.900
What?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.940
No...

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.060
No!

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.100
Commander Huang,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.140
join me!

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.900
I won't

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.740
disturb Your Lordship any longer.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.779
Your Lordship, be careful not

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.899
to kill the demon.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.780
Tomorrow, she will be sentenced
in front of all the ministers.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.500
Don't worry.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.580
She's in good hands.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.900
I take my leave.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.100
No...

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.500
No...

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.539
No...

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.500
No!

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.739
Stay away!

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.179
No!

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.980
Don't come any closer!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.340
That's enough.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.620
He's gone.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.140
He dared do this to you...

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.660
It must have hurt terribly.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.900
I'm fine.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.900
But you really scared me.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.139
I thought Xiling Heng actually

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.820
cut you with a blade.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.619
You must be hungry.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.100
Have some honey.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.340
Here.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.299
Slowly.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.500
I don't want you to choke.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.380
Easy there.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.380
I remember now.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.419
That scent.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.980
It was Huang Gou'er.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.500
That explains everything.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.700
After the Charm Spell was lifted,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.859
my brother realized you were a demon.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.300
But you're the Empress.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.259
He needs the world to know
you're a demon

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.579
so he can get rid of you.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.540
That's why he had Huang Gou'er
do all those things to frame you.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.740
But

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.340
who poisoned you with the Gu?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.580
Maybe

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.900
we'll have our answer tomorrow.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.259
The urgent matter

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.779
is to clear your name

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.900
and get you out safely.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.700
Xiling Heng knows I'm a fox demon now.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.820
He'd never let me go.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.940
Don't worry.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.620
I'll figure out a way.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.300
All right.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.499
You wicked demon!

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.100
You've been lurking beside me
all this time

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.419
and used sorcery to charm me!

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.900
You almost

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.900
caused my downfall.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.100
You've killed
all those people in the palace.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.900
Your crimes are grave!

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.500
Your Majesty,

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.179
I was framed.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.300
How dare you still say that!

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.859
You must've killed the Empress too!

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.059
Huang Gou'er!

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.500
You know full well

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.740
who the real murderer is.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.779
Your Majesty.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.619
This wicked demon

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.979
should be burned alive immediately

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.420
to appease the Empress's spirit.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.460
What do

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.340
the ministers think?

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.979
Kill her!

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.819
Your Majesty, the fox demon must die!

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.800
Kill the fox demon!

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.139
- Your Majesty, you mustn't hesitate.
- She must not be spared!

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.139
- Absolutely not!
- You must order her death!

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.420
Wait.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.180
Lord Wing.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.500
What's he doing here?

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.940
The true killer is you,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.500
isn't it,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.780
Huang Gou'er?

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.859
Commander Huang?

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.900
How could it be Commander Huang?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.180
Your Lordship,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.660
what...

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.300
what nonsense are you spouting?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.780
Lord Wing.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.580
What is this about?

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.740
Huang Gou'er,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.740
you disguised yourself in pelts
as a white fox

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.940
to frame the fox demon for the murders

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.540
and misled the maid Hupo
and eunuch Jing Gai'er

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.460
into believing the Empress
was the heart-ripping fox demon.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.060
I found this pelt

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.780
and the murder weapon in your quarters.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.620
The wounds match perfectly

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.420
with the victims.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.659
Is there more to this case, after all?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.100
What's going on here?

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.460
How can you verify your claims?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.739
What's to say
you didn't forge the evidence?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.460
You don't have to admit it now.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.460
Let's keep going.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.580
You also decapitated maid Hupo
and eunuch Jing Gai'er,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.540
didn't you?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.939
- What?
- Surely Commander Huang did that?

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.140
How could it be him?

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.300
Xuan'er.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.340
Have you also been bewitched

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.539
by this fox demon?

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.179
Huh?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.980
I just don't want
the real culprit to go free.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.700
I'm sure no official here

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.179
wants a miscarriage of justice

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.939
on Xiling Kingdom's court.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.259
That's right.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.780
Lies and slander!

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.579
I led the people

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.740
who found those two heads
on the demon's bed.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.379
They all saw it.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.300
She's the culprit!

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.340
Then, what about

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.180
this bloodstained uniform?

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.019
I found this commander's uniform

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.100
in your residence.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.580
The emblem on it is custom-made
by the Imperial Household Department

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.260
and belongs exclusively
to you as commander of the guards.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.060
Well?

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.660
Will you say

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.979
I forged this as well?

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.100
This...

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.339
This got stained when I found
the two headless bodies this morning.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.339
If you ask me,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.380
it must have gotten on you accidentally
during your nighttime murders.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.619
Your Majesty, I can testify.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.499
It was Huang Gou'er
who decapitated Jing Gai'er.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.619
I saw it all.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.660
He was wearing this same uniform then.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.939
So the real murderer is him!

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.579
Then, the Empress was innocent?

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.179
He framed her as a demon!

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.660
This is a crime punishable by death!

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.460
After murdering,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.100
you placed the heads
in the Empress's bed.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.419
When she woke,
you barged in to arrest her,

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.300
claiming she killed
to silence the victims.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.340
Think carefully, everyone.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.100
If one wanted to silence someone,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.819
would they leave their bloody heads

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.579
on their own bed

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.100
and then sleep peacefully?

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.459
His Lordship makes a good point.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.179
It seems the Empress really was framed.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.100
I wondered

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.859
how she didn't notice

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.340
someone put heads in her bed.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.340
Then, I found this.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.100
Your Majesty.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.500
This is Sleep-Inducing Gu.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.500
Huang Gou'er,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.940
as commander of the guards,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.340
you even know how to use Gu poisons.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.740
Quite a hidden skill you have.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.500
Besides the Sleep-Inducing Gu,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.460
did you use other types of Gu

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.460
on anyone else?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.260
Huang Gou'er,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.060
will you admit your guilt?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.300
It's all true.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.539
I killed them.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.419
I used Gu poisons. I plead guilty.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.539
Guards.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.979
Take Huang Gou'er away.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.219
His execution is to be arranged.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.340
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.340
Come on.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.180
Your Majesty.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.580
Huang Gou'er knows Gu poisons.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.059
If he secretly used Gu
on others in court,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.979
executing him now

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.100
means the poisons won't be lifted.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.700
Why not

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.179
hand him over to me first

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.019
for thorough interrogation

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.179
to ensure everyone's safety

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.059
before executing him?

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.379
- That makes sense.
- That's reasonable.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.339
Indeed.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.140
His Lordship is right.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.700
Very well.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.780
I entrust this matter to you, Lord Wing.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.300
Yes, Your Majesty.
