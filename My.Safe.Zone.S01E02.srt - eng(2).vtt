00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:01.985
Go back to your life in New York.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.745
Your job, your fiancée.

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:07.425
There's nothing left for me in New York.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.585
I'm thinking of moving back for work too.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.825
Are you serious?

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:15.225
-Can I make a reservation?
-No.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:17.825
Why is my life falling apart like this?

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:18.825
So you came back

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.825
because you broke up with Kate?

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:24.385
Jane, I saw them in this position.

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:26.025
Does it still hurt?

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:32.385
That's what heartbreak feels like.

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:35.865
Better to hurt now…

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:39.265
Than be lied to for longer.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:47.305
You've never been in a relationship,
but you give great advice.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:54.585
Just like you, you're good
at everything, except this.

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.425
-Except what?
-Love.

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.905
If someone doesn't love you anymore,
why keep loving them?

00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:09.665
If they love someone else,
then breaking up is the right thing.

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:24.945
You may not have her anymore,
but you still have me.

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:38.745
You're up?

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.585
-Where's Aunt Tuk?
-She's out exercising.

00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:47.625
Good. So we can talk now.

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:49.545
Talk about what?

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.825
Jane, you know I woke up thinking
I had to go see a physical therapist.

00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:54.305
Why?

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:56.305
My back hurts.
I thought it was a pinched nerve

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:59.185
or a slipped disc or something.

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:02.825
Your back hurts?

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:13.985
Why'd you make me sleep on the floor?

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:16.065
The bed's not even small.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:18.384
We used to share it when we were kids.

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:20.944
Why wouldn't you let me sleep on the bed?

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:23.625
Did you do it on purpose?

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:26.185
Were you getting back at me
for leaving eight years ago?

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.585
No. You're the one who insisted
on sleeping on the floor.

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:33.305
No way.
I'd never ask to sleep on the floor.

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:44.145
Lin, what's wrong?

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:11.065
You started it,
and then you just passed out?

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:22.985
Good night.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.825
Let me sleep with you.

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:01.585
Do you remember anything?

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:07.185
I remember telling you
I saw those two in bed.

00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:09.665
And I said who knows
how many times they've slept together.

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:16.585
That's all you remember?

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:19.585
Nothing else?

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:22.425
What else should I remember?

00:06:23.265 --> 00:06:24.745
You expect drunk people
to remember everything?

00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:30.865
I bet last night you thought I was Kate.

00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:36.385
No. I've moved on.
I'm not thinking about her at all.

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:40.905
Why?

00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:48.345
Don't ask. Eat your soup with rice

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:50.305
so your hangover goes away.

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:52.705
And go home to shower.

00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:54.145
You smell bad.

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:05.705
I don't smell.

00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:07.745
I already changed clothes.

00:07:16.225 --> 00:07:17.745
You seriously don't remember?

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:21.145
-Jane, did you wipe me down last night?
-You're still here?

00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:22.385
Did you?

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.705
Did you? Or not?

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:29.025
I did.

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:30.865
How?

00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:33.705
I took everything off.

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:36.425
Like everything, everything?

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:38.625
You were puking.
What else was I supposed to do?

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:43.305
You took off… the inside too?

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:45.305
No. I didn't change your underwear.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:48.065
But you must've seen.

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:49.905
Seen what?

00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:56.585
Well…

00:07:57.825 --> 00:07:58.665
My tiny boobs.

00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:01.905
Just the right size.

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:04.345
Jane!

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:06.345
Ugh, don't be shy.

00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:07.785
We've changed clothes together
since we were kids.

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:10.625
Now go home.
I need to get changed for work.

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:12.905
No.

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:15.665
You saw it. You owe me a table.

00:08:16.905 --> 00:08:17.825
Do I?

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:20.025
Or…

00:08:22.345 --> 00:08:23.625
did you give me one last night?

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:31.225
Not yet. Now go home
so I can change for work.

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:35.625
Why are you being so stingy?
I'll only sit there for a few hours.

00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:47.705
-You know what?
-Lin!

00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:49.345
I'll do anything.

00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:54.625
Why are you shy?

00:08:55.465 --> 00:08:57.665
We've seen each other naked since forever.

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:00.585
You really won't let this go?

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.065
That's right.

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:36.905
I'll do anything for that table for two.

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:39.225
Anything?

00:09:45.945 --> 00:09:46.785
Fine.

00:09:49.345 --> 00:09:50.705
You promise?

00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:55.545
But you have to help me
come up with a new menu.

00:09:56.865 --> 00:09:59.585
If it's not done,
you're not getting a table.

00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:06.105
Fine.

00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:08.705
But can I eat first?

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:11.225
No.

00:10:24.025 --> 00:10:25.345
You're still here?

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:27.145
The gate won't open.

00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:29.785
Oops, forgot. My bad.

00:10:34.865 --> 00:10:38.225
I'm so happy
I get to talk to you like this again.

00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:42.625
I mean, I want the table, yeah,

00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:46.905
but talking to you is even better.

00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.225
I'm leaving.

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:22.665
Ugh! Making someone this tiny like me
lift heavy stuff? I'm gonna get ripped.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:24.065
You can even lift it with one hand.

00:11:25.305 --> 00:11:27.465
You pop birth control like candy.

00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:29.185
You're not getting muscles,

00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:30.425
just boobs.

00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:33.585
Jane, she's bullying me. Call the cops.

00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:36.225
-It's true. Look at your boobs.
-Enough.

00:11:36.305 --> 00:11:37.425
Is everything delivered?

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:39.505
Yes.

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.985
Once you're done, wash and start chopping.

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:44.145
-Got it.
-Roger that.

00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:45.785
-I'll do this.
-Jane.

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:47.465
Can we talk now?

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.745
-Who's that?
-How am I supposed to know?

00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:59.825
Is your restaurant really that famous?

00:12:02.145 --> 00:12:03.425
It's not that famous.

00:12:03.505 --> 00:12:04.865
Well,

00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:06.745
she's just being humble.

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:09.385
This place is super popular.

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:12.105
People line up all the time.
A lot of celebrities

00:12:12.185 --> 00:12:14.025
come to the restaurant.

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:16.225
Magazines want to interview her,

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:18.225
but she refuses.

00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:20.785
Is that true, Jane?

00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:27.865
-Chop, chop, chop.
-Chop, chop, chop.

00:12:27.945 --> 00:12:29.185
Did you wear the gloves?

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:30.905
These gloves are so hard to put on.

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:34.145
You're back already? Did you even shower?

00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:37.385
No.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.065
You just changed clothes
and came right over?

00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:41.385
I'm in a rush.

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:44.145
So when are you going back?

00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:47.025
When are you going back?

00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:51.825
Whenever I feel like it.

00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:55.225
Then you can eat here
whenever it's available.

00:12:56.465 --> 00:12:57.345
Hey.

00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:02.025
So, when?

00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:05.985
Two to three months.

00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:08.985
Um, Jane? Is this size

00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:11.625
okay? This size?

00:13:11.705 --> 00:13:13.945
You've been doing it every day.

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:18.105
-About this size.
-This size?

00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:19.465
Not this, right?

00:13:20.145 --> 00:13:21.665
This long is good.

00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:23.305
Okay.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.705
Yeah, about this. I told you.

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:27.105
-It's this size.
-Yeah.

00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:29.585
-It's this size.
-This size.

00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:33.545
Go.

00:13:38.825 --> 00:13:40.745
Why do you want the reservation so badly?

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:46.225
Because Pie is important.

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.145
How important?

00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:50.745
Important to my future.

00:13:54.545 --> 00:13:57.145
And about that new menu,
what do I have to do?

00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:08.865
This is the current menu list.

00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:18.385
Why are you laughing?

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:20.745
The food looks tasty,

00:14:20.825 --> 00:14:24.905
but the photos?
Even cheap diners take better pictures.

00:14:42.305 --> 00:14:43.545
You're good at photography, right?

00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:50.145
I mean, I don't want to brag,
but yeah, I'm number one.

00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:53.465
Then take new ones for me.

00:14:59.785 --> 00:15:01.785
I'm a fashion photographer, Jane.

00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:03.225
So what? You can't shoot food?

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:05.825
I can't. It's a totally different style.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.425
Then learn.

00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:13.585
You want to get your table's worth, huh?

00:15:14.265 --> 00:15:15.225
Yes.

00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:18.505
Come up with ideas. Cook. Shoot.

00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:26.345
Even if it's not my expertise,
it'll still look better than your shots.

00:15:28.145 --> 00:15:29.905
You used your phone, right?

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:32.745
I used a camera.

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:39.385
Liar.

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:42.225
Fine, it was my phone.

00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:44.545
I knew it.

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:47.345
Why? Or…

00:15:47.425 --> 00:15:49.985
No more "or."
I'll do it. I'll start today.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.865
Are you changing your mind?

00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:02.785
I'm not.

00:16:02.865 --> 00:16:06.305
But when I work on new menus,
I use my home kitchen.

00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:15.785
Is this the new dish for next month?

00:16:16.385 --> 00:16:17.225
It's lunch.

00:16:30.905 --> 00:16:34.425
You should be hungry.
You didn't eat breakfast.

00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:37.745
I could've had the leftover porridge.

00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:40.745
I already made this for you.
Eat it while it's still warm.

00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:45.705
It looks delicious. Can I eat now?

00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:52.905
Jane, wait.

00:17:15.545 --> 00:17:16.665
Eat with me.

00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:22.424
Eating alone is sad.

00:17:43.865 --> 00:17:45.505
You didn't eat breakfast either, right?

00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:02.785
It's so good.

00:18:08.185 --> 00:18:09.025
One sec.

00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:12.865
Yes, Pie?

00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:15.145
I'll be back.

00:18:19.745 --> 00:18:21.465
I'm at a friend's house.

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:24.105
Lin.

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:33.945
Your mom told me to come find you here.

00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:38.545
The gate wasn't locked,
so I just walked in.

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:48.185
You didn't have to bring anything for me.

00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:50.665
This bakery went viral for being so good.

00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:53.265
I was in the area, so I brought you some.

00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:59.745
In the area?
This house isn't even on a main road.

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:04.225
Let me guess.
The bakery's next to the flower shop?

00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:07.585
And the flower shop
happens to be next to the bakery.

00:19:07.665 --> 00:19:08.985
So I just grabbed it.

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:15.105
Grabbed it? Are you a model or a thief?

00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:17.225
What a coincidence.

00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:22.825
Take a seat.

00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:33.185
No wonder you said you could get a table.

00:19:33.945 --> 00:19:35.305
You live next door

00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:37.225
and you're close friends.

00:19:38.225 --> 00:19:41.345
We've been close since we were kids.
I'm trying to get you a table.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:47.225
If I get one, I promise

00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:49.065
I'll treat you to ten meals.

00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:54.585
Lin.

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:58.145
Sorry I forgot to bring you water.

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:00.785
This is for you.

00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:17.225
It's been packed lately,

00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:19.425
but I've been trying to find you a table.

00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:24.385
I already told Lin how hard it is,

00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:29.465
but she keeps begging
for a table every day.

00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:36.305
Oh.

00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:39.265
You're really trying to get me a table?

00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:42.545
Thank you

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:44.545
for thinking of me this much.

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:49.425
Last time we met,

00:20:49.945 --> 00:20:52.145
I told Lin
I wanted to try your restaurant,

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:56.025
but I didn't expect she'd try this hard.

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:58.065
You're so sweet to me.

00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:15.465
So this is Pie, the model you mentioned?

00:21:15.545 --> 00:21:16.585
Yeah.

00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:18.185
You don't know her?

00:21:18.265 --> 00:21:19.745
No. She must not be that famous.

00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:25.185
Is this the one you said was important?

00:21:25.265 --> 00:21:26.545
Yes.

00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:28.585
Her mom owns W Magazine,

00:21:28.665 --> 00:21:30.465
a major fashion magazine in Thailand.

00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:36.505
I still think she came to flirt,
not just to drop by.

00:21:39.025 --> 00:21:40.065
Isn't it good?

00:21:40.145 --> 00:21:43.145
At least I'll have someone new
and stop bothering you.

00:21:43.225 --> 00:21:45.025
You'll have time to work.

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:51.105
That's good, but isn't it too fast?
You just broke up with Kate.

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:55.705
And don't you still have work
waiting in New York?

00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:00.985
If I end up dating Pie,

00:22:02.065 --> 00:22:04.025
I might just come back and work for her.

00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.345
So you know she's hitting on you?

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:10.585
Oh?

00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:20.385
Okay, what else do you need me to do?

00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:24.585
Nothing. You can go home.

00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:26.585
Oh?

00:22:28.185 --> 00:22:30.025
There's still a ton to do.

00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:33.945
What are you cooking now?

00:22:38.985 --> 00:22:40.025
Pork stew with eggs.

00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:01.665
It doesn't taste like the first time.

00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:04.265
I followed a YouTube recipe. Is it good?

00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:06.705
So good!

00:23:10.465 --> 00:23:13.385
My girlfriend makes the best pork stew
with eggs in the world.

00:23:16.665 --> 00:23:18.025
I'm filming.

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:20.145
Stop filming.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:45.785
Come with me tomorrow
to get stuff for five-spice eggs.

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:49.825
Didn't you just cook them?

00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:54.385
The flavor's right,
but the story's not there yet.

00:23:56.105 --> 00:23:58.345
People just care if it tastes good.

00:24:02.665 --> 00:24:04.745
A story makes food taste better.

00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:11.225
And stories

00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:13.465
make people stronger too.

00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:21.545
Don't forget your camera tomorrow.

00:24:31.865 --> 00:24:32.905
She's single.

00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:35.985
She said they're childhood friends.

00:24:36.865 --> 00:24:38.185
But no photos together?

00:24:39.265 --> 00:24:40.145
Weird.

00:24:49.745 --> 00:24:51.745
Auntie! You're finally back.

00:24:51.825 --> 00:24:53.985
I was waiting for you
to try my five-spice eggs.

00:24:55.185 --> 00:24:58.585
Llin's been helping you all day.
Did you two make up already?

00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:00.025
Not yet.

00:25:00.825 --> 00:25:02.505
You're playing hard to get?

00:25:04.985 --> 00:25:06.185
Huh?

00:25:06.865 --> 00:25:07.945
A little.

00:25:09.185 --> 00:25:12.545
You want her to realize your worth, right?

00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:17.825
Have you told her?

00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:20.145
Told her what?

00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:21.265
Come on.

00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:23.265
I don't have the guts.

00:25:25.985 --> 00:25:29.105
Because she's about to get married, right?

00:25:32.985 --> 00:25:35.545
No. They broke up.

00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:39.745
What? Does Aom know?

00:25:41.025 --> 00:25:42.185
Wait!

00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:44.025
Lin hasn't told Aunt Aom yet.

00:25:47.825 --> 00:25:49.945
Okay… Yeah, I understand.

00:25:52.545 --> 00:25:54.425
Aom liked Kate a lot.

00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:58.505
And what about you?

00:26:02.425 --> 00:26:04.465
I don't think I'll wait around this time.

00:26:26.225 --> 00:26:28.625
What are you doing here at night?
Can't sleep?

00:26:29.305 --> 00:26:31.665
I forgot to ask, besides the camera,
do I need to bring anything else?

00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:33.145
Just bring yourself.

00:26:35.905 --> 00:26:37.265
That's all you came to ask?

00:26:43.025 --> 00:26:46.385
I've never done a shoot. How would I know?

00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:51.185
I'm a chef,
not a world-class photographer like you.

00:26:52.025 --> 00:26:53.625
Was that sarcasm?

00:26:53.705 --> 00:26:55.465
No. Just facts.

00:27:02.865 --> 00:27:03.905
I can't sleep.

00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:07.105
Are you still thinking about Kate?

00:27:09.905 --> 00:27:11.785
If you don't sleep,
will you be okay tomorrow?

00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:19.545
Then you go rest. I'll head home.

00:27:26.185 --> 00:27:27.065
Let's go.

00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:33.065
It's so close. I can walk alone.

00:27:35.105 --> 00:27:36.025
I won't get lost.

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:40.865
I'll walk with you.

00:28:26.425 --> 00:28:29.425
I thought we were just getting eggs
at the market.

00:28:30.745 --> 00:28:32.505
If you're going to cook for people,

00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:35.945
they should know
the food comes from good places.

00:28:50.305 --> 00:28:51.865
Such nice weather.

00:28:52.385 --> 00:28:54.105
I only took a short drive from Bangkok.

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.465
Then let's come again sometime.

00:29:03.945 --> 00:29:05.385
Let's come together again.

00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:29.105
Be careful.

00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:22.225
Ms. Jane.

00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:26.345
This way, please.

00:30:31.465 --> 00:30:33.265
A bug flew into your hair earlier.

00:30:39.265 --> 00:30:40.145
Let's go.

00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:55.865
We raise the ducks free-range,

00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:57.705
and bring them in at night.

00:30:58.905 --> 00:31:01.065
Today I'll let you
collect the eggs yourself.

00:31:02.425 --> 00:31:04.305
Here's your basket.

00:31:04.385 --> 00:31:05.745
Have fun.

00:31:05.825 --> 00:31:07.145
Thank you.

00:31:09.665 --> 00:31:12.145
Come on. Hurry and put on your boots.
Let's collect eggs.

00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:19.265
-I'll help you.
-No, I can do it.

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:47.425
Why are you being so sweet today?

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.145
I've done bad things to you.

00:31:56.545 --> 00:31:59.385
Now I'm trying to make it up,
so you'll forgive me.

00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:18.345
Are you done?

00:33:18.945 --> 00:33:20.905
We'll break for lunch and continue later.

00:33:50.025 --> 00:33:50.985
Did that hurt?

00:34:06.345 --> 00:34:07.345
I'm sorry.

00:34:33.865 --> 00:34:35.665
DUTCH MILL WHITE MALT

00:34:46.385 --> 00:34:47.264
It's delicious.

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.385
Why don't you hold your own can?

00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:03.785
What do I have to do…

00:35:04.945 --> 00:35:06.265
for you to forgive me?

00:35:10.145 --> 00:35:11.185
I will soon.

00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:14.585
Your "soon" is taking forever…

00:35:17.865 --> 00:35:18.985
Jane.

00:35:22.905 --> 00:35:24.225
-Jane.
-Hmm?

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:28.865
You don't need to come so close.

00:35:29.665 --> 00:35:31.065
I thought you didn't hear me.

00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:34.665
I've forgiven you…

00:35:40.265 --> 00:35:41.705
But I'm still hurt.

00:35:51.785 --> 00:35:52.945
Eat up.

00:35:53.745 --> 00:35:55.665
Once we're done, we'll collect more eggs.

00:36:09.745 --> 00:36:10.705
I'm sorry.

00:36:34.785 --> 00:36:38.465
Why don't you make something more exciting
than simple food like five-spice eggs?

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:42.705
Do you know why my restaurant does well?

00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:46.785
These days people are so busy.
They don't have time.

00:36:46.865 --> 00:36:50.985
Moms don't have time to cook.
Kids don't have time to go home and eat.

00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:55.625
Everyone's busy with work and school,
eating out every day.

00:36:57.025 --> 00:36:59.825
And they forget the taste
of simple food their mom used to make.

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:01.385
So I make those dishes

00:37:01.465 --> 00:37:05.425
in a more interesting way.
But they still taste familiar.

00:37:06.105 --> 00:37:07.705
When people eat them,
they remember childhood,

00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:10.225
and dinners with the whole family.

00:37:10.825 --> 00:37:13.305
It fills their stomach, warms their heart,

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:15.385
and makes them want to come back again.

00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:22.745
What's wrong?

00:37:23.665 --> 00:37:24.505
Are you hungry?

00:37:25.905 --> 00:37:26.825
No.

00:37:42.465 --> 00:37:43.945
Don't do that, Jane.

00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:45.785
Do what?

00:37:47.785 --> 00:37:49.225
What you're doing.

00:37:51.145 --> 00:37:52.265
You mean wiping the mud?

00:37:58.505 --> 00:37:59.945
What do you think I'm doing?

00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:05.785
I thought

00:38:07.025 --> 00:38:08.585
you were shooing away a bug.

00:38:21.425 --> 00:38:22.865
My heart is beating so hard.

00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:25.145
She'll notice.

00:38:30.105 --> 00:38:32.145
Oh, Jane, you're done already?

00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:35.465
I've prepared something for you.

00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:39.105
The mangoes just came in,
so I picked some for you too.

00:38:39.185 --> 00:38:41.025
-Thank you.
-Sure!

00:38:43.785 --> 00:38:45.185
Do you come here often?

00:38:49.225 --> 00:38:53.105
She gave you a lot.
Is she into you or something?

00:38:54.905 --> 00:38:55.745
No.

00:39:02.025 --> 00:39:03.185
But I am.

00:39:06.665 --> 00:39:07.865
You're into her?

00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:12.785
Into you.

00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:39.025
Jane?

00:39:41.865 --> 00:39:42.705
Jane?

00:39:46.465 --> 00:39:47.865
Jane?

00:39:49.465 --> 00:39:51.305
I asked if you come here often.

00:39:52.465 --> 00:39:53.785
Oh.

00:39:53.865 --> 00:39:54.705
Sometimes.

00:39:55.305 --> 00:39:56.745
Not that often.

00:39:59.185 --> 00:40:02.145
Here you go.

00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:04.185
-That's a lot.
-Be careful, it's heavy.

00:40:06.705 --> 00:40:08.465
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:40:28.345 --> 00:40:29.345
Are we cooking now?

00:40:30.745 --> 00:40:32.345
Let's shower first.

00:40:34.105 --> 00:40:35.705
Come on. I'll take this inside.

00:40:37.865 --> 00:40:38.745
See you in a bit.

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:52.265
I've been in the sun all day.

00:41:09.145 --> 00:41:10.585
Can you get me the pork belly?

00:41:22.985 --> 00:41:26.065
-Anything else?
-Palm sugar. It's in this cabinet.

00:41:34.745 --> 00:41:37.025
-Do you want the braising spices too?
-Yeah.

00:41:45.265 --> 00:41:46.505
Alright, I'll get them myself.

00:42:03.905 --> 00:42:04.985
Are you okay?

00:42:24.905 --> 00:42:26.345
Are you okay?

00:42:33.145 --> 00:42:35.585
You should go put on an apron.

00:43:39.905 --> 00:43:45.585
CAN I LOVE YOU?

00:43:50.185 --> 00:43:52.865
CAN I LOVE YOU?

00:43:55.465 --> 00:43:56.305
Lin.

00:44:02.425 --> 00:44:03.585
Can you find it?

00:44:07.065 --> 00:44:08.825
Are you slacking off?

00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:15.145
Your closet's full.
How am I supposed to know where it is?

00:44:15.745 --> 00:44:17.105
It takes time to look.

00:44:17.185 --> 00:44:18.665
And did you find it?

00:44:19.265 --> 00:44:20.345
Not yet.

00:44:34.865 --> 00:44:35.745
It's here.

00:44:39.665 --> 00:44:41.345
Come, I'll help you put it on.

00:45:06.425 --> 00:45:07.745
You loved me, Jane?

00:45:25.865 --> 00:45:27.545
Can you love me?

00:45:29.065 --> 00:45:30.545
I broke up with Kate, Mom.

00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:33.545
If you walk away now, you get nothing.

00:45:33.625 --> 00:45:34.825
But if you stay,

00:45:34.905 --> 00:45:37.545
even if those two love each other,

00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:39.265
everything will still be yours.

00:45:42.905 --> 00:45:45.585
If what I said earlier made you upset,

00:45:46.425 --> 00:45:47.465
I'm sorry.

00:45:47.545 --> 00:45:49.625
If you can only see me as a friend,

00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:51.345
then I'll just be a friend.

00:46:24.305 --> 00:46:25.265
