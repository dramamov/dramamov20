This is Tailah,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.945
the person I...

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.560
have a crush on in the other world.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.240
Would you like to buy one more snack?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.920
We've got a buy-one-get-one-free deal...

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.680
and the cashier's number
comes free, too.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.560
That would be sweet.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.200
Don't leave it hanging, give it a call.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.100
Sure thing.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.170
Here's your QR code.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.920
Hey, Thorn.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.320
A new delivery order just came in.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.880
Can you help?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.960
Yeah, sure!

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:08.584
Yeah!

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.720
But wait...

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.080
my shift's over.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.560
Thorn,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.320
could you please help me?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.640
I have to work on a group project.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.040
Please, my angel.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.240
Please, Thorn, my little angel!

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.880
Please, please, please!

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.060
- I...
- Could you?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.280
Here you go!

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.960
It'll just take a sec.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.170
It's just around the corner,
so do it on your way home.

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:32.694
Please.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.640
And I had always said yes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.800
whenever he asked me for help.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.197
You like her?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.920
Absolutely.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.400
She's gorgeous,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.880
with perfect skin,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.800
and sexy.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.840
What man could resist?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.720
Don't you like her?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.600
Aw,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.120
alright, Giga Chad.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.000
Then, what's your type?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.560
Ignoring me, huh?

00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:11.960
How about now?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.080
Answer me!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
What are you doing?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.640
Come on.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280
I like...

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.480
someone who's not into me.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.320
Bruh!

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.520
Can't believe I waited for that.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.800
You act like those men in K-drama.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.760
I keep that feeling inside...

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.504
and haven't told him.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.880
Tai!

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.620
Wait,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.865
you do remember me!

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.120
I heard you lost your memory.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.880
I'm happy that you remember me.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.717
Wait,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.080
it is really you?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.000
What?

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.360
How did you get here?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.840
I called you the other day, didn't I?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.960
Tai who?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.800
So you're Tai!

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.560
That Tai!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.520
Quite literally.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.800
That's my name.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.960
Are you alright?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
Did you...

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.120
also reincarnate
into a parallel universe?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.440
I did...

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.440
say a complete moron!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.040
Do you need help?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.760
You've been
watching movies or something?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.200
Po!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.060
Your hottest groomsman has arrived.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.280
Who else is here?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.880
Just get out for now.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.760
Wait, here's your top!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Thank you.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600
Gosh,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.000
Po!

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.960
Whoa!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.920
I thought I'd never catch you
in this outfit.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.880
When I heard
you'd been in a car accident,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.480
I thought you'd never get married.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.680
And when Tailah found outâ€¦

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.880
he whimpers like a puppy.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.211
Do you...

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.880
remember me?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.280
I'm Torphong.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.440
Your bestie, Tor.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.040
Tor!

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.560
- I do remember!
- Come on, Tor.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.200
He just got out of the hospital.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.480
What's with all the questions?

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.240
Alright, alright.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.520
Think of it as driving away bad luck.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.320
From now on,
I wish you and His Excellency

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.000
a long and healthy marriage.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.560
Right, Tai?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.930
Huh?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.800
- Uh...
- Right?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.960
From here, I wish you and him...

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.080
Oh, Your Excellency!

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080
Hello, there.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.720
You've never been
interested in Apo before.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.360
Suddenly you say yes to marrying him?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.840
It's obvious you did it for money.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.080
Poor Apo,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.200
you shouldn't have fallen for this guy.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.000
Uh...

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.000
Are you...

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.400
having a staring contest?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.120
Ya!

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.840
I decided on the outfit I like.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640
What do you think?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.640
Whatever you like,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.200
I'll like, too.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.960
If we're done here,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.040
should we go?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.320
But I have something to take care of,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.120
so I'll drop you off at home.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.120
Your Excellency?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.960
If you wouldn't mind,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.320
may I borrow your groom-to-be

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.840
for a small bachelor party?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.960
I promise

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.720
I won't let him get drunk.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.560
No worries, Your Excellency.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.760
Don't stay out too late.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.520
He's taking this act too seriously.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.560
If he keeps doing this,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.600
my heart will truly shiver.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620
Or I'll worry.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.440
Go ahead, guys.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.520
It's my treat.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.120
"My treat," my ass.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.760
This is your club,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.840
and so are the drinks.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.440
You get it both ways.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.600
Alright, Mr. Rector!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.920
Even in a bachelor party,
you still sweat the small stuff.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.080
Did you just make fun of my dad?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.560
Whenever you complain,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.920
you're just like your dad.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.000
We graduated a while ago,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.640
but seeing you surprised me.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.640
I thought I was meeting your dad!

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.160
Right, Po.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.920
Be honest with me.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.880
While we were away,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.440
what did you do to make him
fall for you so hard

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.080
he ended up proposing?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.920
Back then,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.800
every time he saw you,

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.040
he acted like you were smelly socks.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.640
Well,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.600
I didn't do anything.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.465
Really?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.160
Or...

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.400
you pulled out your ace in the hole

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.120
to win His Excellency's heart?

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.680
Hey,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.960
are you outta your mind?

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.200
I didn't do anything.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.280
Whoa!

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.400
Judging by that, you definitely did!

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.640
Hey, our friend officially has a hubby,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680
- so let's toast!
- Uh...

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.474
Come on!

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.280
Cheers to Young Master Apo!

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:33.086
Whoa!

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.320
Does liquor really taste this good?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.560
It absolutely does!

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.200
Only the best for you today.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.320
Wait, wait, Po...

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.040
Don't hold back on the good stuff!

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.560
Here.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.360
- I'll...
- Wait...

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.200
- get you some more.
- Tor!

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.760
Here you go, Po.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.120
A special drink from me.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.400
Huh? Let me see.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.840
What's the matter with you?!

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.320
Huh?

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.000
Po was just discharged,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.520
so go easy on him, would you?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.040
Here,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.240
have some appetizers,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280
so you don't get drunk.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.240
Here.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.881
Hey,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.640
have whatever you want today.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.280
It's on me.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.280
Why did you decide
to treat me all of a sudden?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.440
I wanna thank you

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.920
for helping me with college stuff

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.598
and Y MART.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.760
Go ahead.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.840
Huh?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.400
Thank you.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.960
There you go.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.200
Eat up!

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.440
Thank you for everything.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:49.919
It's all good.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.755
If...

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.160
there's anything you need help with,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.880
you can tell me.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.960
Really?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.640
Anything?

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.240
You mean it?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.078
Then,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.367
Phopthorn, could you...

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.080
be my guarantor for the motorcycle loan?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.800
Please...

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.280
Please.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.120
There you go.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.960
You know I'd have no one else

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.720
if it weren't for you.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.680
You're the only one I have, Phopthorn.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.040
You know how important this is to me,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.320
so could you please help?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.440
Please.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.640
Please...

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.720
Oh, thank you.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960
Po.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.680
Apo.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.640
Apo!

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.080
Huh?

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.240
Are you okay?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
What made you zone out?

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.400
Oh,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.760
I'm fine.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.120
Are you feeling sick?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480
Wanna go to the hospital?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.490
Hey...

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.800
Po,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.160
you're such a lightweight now.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.920
You blushed only after a few sips.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.010
Huh...

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.520
Oh!

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.720
Then,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.400
let me hit the restroom for a sec.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.600
I told you to go easy on him.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.400
He just got out of the hospital.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.480
[Tai: I passed by your favorite cake shop.
Tai: I'll buy some and take it to you]

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.720
[Tai: Do you have plans today?
Tai: Call me if you want to go anywhere]

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.960
[Tai: I'm worried.
Apo: Yeah, yeah]

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.200
[Tai: Don't forget to drink water
Tai: and have some food]

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.480
[Tai: Po, are you up?
Tai: You'll probably be hungover]

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.760
This Tailah

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.280
is into me?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440
Be careful!

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.280
- What did you say?
- I think that's enough.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.600
It's all gone.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.720
- Enough. Put that down.
- It's gone already?

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.480
Oh, no,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.960
don't break my jar.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.240
- Mr. Rector, let's sing!
- You're gonna break that!

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.320
- Po...
- â™«Hello...â™«

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.920
- Aye, aye, aye!
- Careful...

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.200
â™«I'm Apoâ™«

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.200
He's got that vibrato.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.160
- Come here.
- No...

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.840
- Yeah, move back.
- Come on, get back here.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.680
Ugh...

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.080
Hold him nicely so I can get this shot.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.130
Tai!

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.600
I'm so happy!

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.320
What are you so happy about?

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.280
That we met, Tai!

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.000
Mm.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.560
You know, I even thought

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.160
that I...

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.240
would be all alone in this world.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.760
Good thing I met you!

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.000
Tai, I miss you so much.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.920
I totally love you, buddy.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.160
There.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.080
You just spawned after that call,
Your Excellency.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.920
You called him?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.880
Yeah.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.840
Who's gonna carry him home?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.640
I could.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.000
Don't bother.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.560
I can take my fiance home.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.720
Huh?

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.400
Home?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.520
No, I'm not going.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.520
- I don't wanna go home.
- Let's go.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.680
No...

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.400
I'm not going home!

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.160
He carried Po all the way there...

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.120
I've got everything recorded, you know?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.500
What?

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.520
Why are you so grumpy?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.080
I'm so happy!

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.480
Thank you, Tailah,

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.280
for coming back to me again.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.360
Thanks, Lord,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.480
for letting me meet him again!

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.380
Ow...

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.160
I wanna throw up...

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.560
But I also want more.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.760
Another shot, please!

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.840
I want sour curry!

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.040
I want sour curry. I want sour curry!

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.800
Where can I get sour curry at this hour?

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.640
Gosh!

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.400
What do you even think about?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.620
Come here.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.520
Lay down.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.690
Pillow...

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.040
Stay still.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.560
If Tai were this nice to me in
the other world, it would be nice.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.280
I see.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.120
You are into him, aren't you?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.440
But it's fine,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.400
since this Tai likes Apo.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.360
That means...

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.760
you also like me!

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.760
Hey.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.800
Do you even think of me
while you're drunk?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.160
I do...

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.960
I totally do.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.280
I do miss you a lot,

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.160
Tai!

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.480
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.360
I'm happy!

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.240
- There,
- Ow...

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.680
how's your life here?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.080
Ugh!

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.400
What?

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.000
If you miss him that badly,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.360
call him to take care of you, then.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.600
"Him"?

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.720
Hey...

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.840
Who...

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440
is him?

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.160
How did I get home?

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.440
Did Tai take me here?

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.120
[Torphong]

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.640
Did His Excellency take me home?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.560
Is that rice porridge?

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.720
I'm just craving that.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.280
What?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.620
Huh?

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640
Are you full?

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.240
But there's still a lot left.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.960
What about mine?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.480
That was all.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.680
Huh?

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.600
What?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.600
Are you okay?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I'm fine.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040
Wait.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.800
You definitely are not.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.600
I can tell.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.800
You even made breakfast
and didn't share.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.620
Are you...

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.640
mad at me?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.600
Mad?

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.360
I'm not mad.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.520
Why would I be mad at you?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.560
I'm in a hurry.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.760
If you're hungry, order yourself food.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.160
Right,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.560
if you don't like that idea,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.320
just have Tailah cook for you.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.920
What?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.480
What does that
have to do with Tailah?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.490
Is he...

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.850
jealous?

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.700
That's crazy.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.680
Why would he be?

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.080
Young Master,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.080
Lady Pripprao has invited you to a meal.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.200
She wants to meet privately
before the ceremony,

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.000
so she's clearly asking me
to leave her son.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.800
That's a cliche Thai soap opera!

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.720
Why do you...

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.360
want to meet me today?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.600
Please, have a seat.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480
Please.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.960
I'll get straight to the point

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.280
since the ceremony
is merely a few days away.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.600
Here we go.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.040
Take no offense,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.560
but I still have doubts about you.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280
There she is.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.280
She's really pushing me
to break up with her son.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.640
So,

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.160
this is what we're gonna do.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.480
Well, well, well,

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.360
what's your offer?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.580
Take these bills!

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.800
And break up with my son!

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.840
I think...

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.120
you're underestimating me,
Lady Pripprao.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.880
Why?

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.840
Are you saying
your love for him is genuine?

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.500
No,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.920
I meant...

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.200
you're underestimating my value.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.720
I will break up with your son,

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.480
but you have to make sure

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.360
to hit that subscribe button

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.480
and pay me every month.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.400
If you miss even one payment,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.390
Ya and I...

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.880
will get back to being lovey-dovey!

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.480
And if you miss three payments,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.440
I will tell Ya about this.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.520
And I will be a thorn
in your side forever!

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.720
You little brat!

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.920
This way, even if His Excellency
exposes me as a fake

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.760
and kicks me out,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.180
I'll still have enough money
to start a new life!

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080
Apo!

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.740
Where is your mind flying off to?

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.880
Hello?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.560
Oh, you've arrived, Master?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.520
Of course, you can come in!

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.080
Alright!

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.160
Hello, Master.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.000
Hello.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.280
Hello.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.200
Master,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.120
this is Apo.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160
Apo,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.600
meet Master Libidude.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.360
Hello, Master...

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.280
Master Delulu?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.160
Oh!

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.040
"Libidude."

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.160
Master Labubu.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.400
It's "Libidude"!

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.200
Right, Master Libidude.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400
There!

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.640
Oh, I will tell you this.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.160
Master Libidude is very famous.
He even went viral on the Internet.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.360
He's specialized
in spirit-gazing clairvoyance.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.520
He can tell your past life and future
in just one glance.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.720
He can even see people's past lives.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.040
What clairvoyance?

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.640
- Spirit...
- "Spirit-gazing clairvoyance."

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.440
- "Spirit-gazing"?
- Mm!

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.640
Master,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.640
can you sense anything?

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.240
Peculiar.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600
What is?

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.420
I cannot tell.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.520
All I can say is...

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.000
I can sense a peculiar energy

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.160
possessing this body.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.240
But I don't have a clue what it is.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.570
So...

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.760
what do you mean by "peculiar energy"?

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.680
It's dorky,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.520
sometimes dumb,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.000
but it has no malice.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.800
What about his fortune?

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.120
Is he a good match for Suriya?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.120
Will their marriage last?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.400
Or will it be over soon?

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.400
If you want to go on to Anagatamsanana,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.480
we'll have to do another ritual.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.920
Of course.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.160
Lady Pripprao suddenly invited
the Young Master for a meal

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.440
and had Master perform
some kind of ritual.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.800
Shit...

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.520
Master,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.200
how was it?

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.320
It's crystal clear.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.280
If the couple stays together,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.440
misery will be their fate.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.440
But the two of them
will get through it well.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.080
The engagement ceremony!

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.280
The engagement ceremony!

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.360
What about it?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.680
Is it not auspicious?

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.800
The ceremony's going to be
full of problems,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.600
and it might end in disaster.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.400
But if these two make it through,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.040
they'll have a lasting marriage

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.440
and a love that can't be broken.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.600
But if all else fails,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.880
this young man's life

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.120
will be turned

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.600
upside down!

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.920
Kim Karissanti Taraka,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.720
the stars have no influence
over any soul.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.880
Hey,

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.160
did my mother throw water at you?

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.920
Oh...

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.370
that's not it.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.990
Your mother had...

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.840
that Master Labubu
perform some kind of ritual.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.320
He was walking around me,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.560
and I was so nervous
that I broke out in a sweat.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.920
What did Master say?

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.080
He said we were kinda a match.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.680
Uh...

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.810
He probably meant you and Apo.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.280
And he said
if we made it through the ceremony,

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.960
we would have a lasting marriage.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.880
He said that?

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.840
Hey, but...

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.360
he also said

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.320
that if we couldn't,

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.080
my life would be "turned upside down!"

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.760
Those are his exact words.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.760
He even pointed his finger at me.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.200
Don't believe him too much.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.080
I think he was making things up.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.080
It was garbage
from the moment he said...

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.600
we'd have a love
that can't be broken.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.320
Who knows?

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.640
Uh...

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.960
I mean,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560
who knows what'll happen.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.120
Nothing is certain.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.960
No matter what,
we'll make it through the ceremony.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.240
Ugh!

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.560
The ceremony is nothing.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.520
You should've seen your mother's face

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.800
and how much she believed
in that Master Delulu.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.120
I don't think

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.800
she's gonna mess
with our ceremony anymore.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.400
You underestimate her.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.960
Could it get worse?

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.720
- Hello.
- Hello, please go ahead inside.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.520
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.200
- How are you doing, ma'am?
- Hi!

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.200
There are available seats inside.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.600
- Congratulations, Boss!
- Oh, Nokpang!

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.920
I'll make my way inside.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.880
Please.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.400
Whoa,

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.240
matching outfits?

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.640
Are you excited, Ya?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.400
Well, a bit.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.680
Thank you for coming.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.320
Congrats, man.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.560
I'll sing loudly for you
during the procession.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.200
Before doing that,

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.240
please wait inside, Mr. Vocalist.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.920
- Hey, Chan.
- Yes?

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.600
Help me out with the guests, would you?

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.760
Of course.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
- This way.
- Please, right this way.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.040
- Hello.
- Hello, there.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.520
Which side of the family?

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.720
We're Apo's friends.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.640
Oh!

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320
I see.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.080
Hey, buddy.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.720
Ooh, that's sweet, then!

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.040
What are you doing?

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.160
It's a high-five.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.320
Apo's friend is also my friend.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.000
After this,
we'll get to meet more often.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.760
So, I think...

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.240
we should get to know each other.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.350
Come on.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.880
Who'd want to be friends with you?

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.120
But if you want
to be more than friends...

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.800
I wouldn't mind.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.320
Whoa!

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
That's smooth!

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.840
Right?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.360
- Not too bad, is it?
- Not at all.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.640
Excuse me, then.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.120
Well, then, allow me to go inside.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.000
Please go ahead.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.360
Oh!

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.010
Whoa.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.920
- Tycoon Meng, Meifan!
- Hi, there!

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.920
- Hello, M.C. Jakkawarn, Lady Pripprao!
- Hello, Lady Pripprao!

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.480
- Beautiful jewelry!
- It must be, right?

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.280
Considering what a special day it is!

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.600
I only gave her the best.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.780
- These are the best.
- Honey!

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.600
- Goodness!
- There he is!

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.200
- Hello.
- Wow!

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.280
Hi, ma'am.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.120
You look even better

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.040
in this ceremony outfit, M.R. Ya!

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.640
- How handsome!
- He got it from his father.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.720
Most definitely, Father.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.360
He has a beautiful mother, too!

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.520
Like Master said, this is the day.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.560
I'm not letting this ceremony slip away.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.920
Hey,

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.080
we can't let our guard down just yet.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.520
I think my mother is still suspicious.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.760
Why does His Excellency

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.600
look handsome today?

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.840
You thought I was handsome?

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.760
Why can I read your mind?

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040
Where's your necklace?

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.680
What?

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.570
This morning, when I got dressed,

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.600
it was really hard to button it up,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.680
so Auntie Da helped me out.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.960
Maybe that's when it happened.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.200
Gosh, I'm screwed!

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.050
I...

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.920
I think it was with the clothes

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.440
that the maids took to the laundry.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.840
I'll look for it.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.760
Wait, Apo.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.360
Stay here.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.560
If you leave,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.400
my family will find out all about this.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.840
Wait here

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.800
and don't go anywhere,

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.880
okay?

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.840
Ugh!

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.680
Don't get them wrinkled, ladies.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.520
Uh, Your Excellency!

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.800
Why are you here?

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.080
Is there anything I can help with?

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.160
Auntie Da,

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.760
have you seen
the necklace Apo's been wearing?

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.600
The one with a purple stone pendant?

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.920
He lost it while he was changing.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.680
Eh...

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.040
I think I might have seen it.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.360
Everyone, let's look for it!

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.600
- Sure!
- Yes, Auntie!

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.720
Eh...

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.400
Where did he leave it?

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:04.950
Eh.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.200
Have you found it?

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.000
- No.
- I don't see anything.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680
Your Excellency,

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.360
I don't think we'll find it now.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.680
But I will tell the girls
to look for it.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.400
But for now, please go back to
the ceremony with Young Master.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.360
Please?

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.320
Of course, Auntie Da.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.480
I'll leave it to you.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.160
Apo really wants
to wear this necklace to the ceremony.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.520
Your Excellency...

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.960
He seems to genuinely care
about my little Young Master.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.520
That puts me at ease.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.760
Please do not be worried.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.200
This is my little Young Master's
special day,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.120
and he will look perfect.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.000
I got it.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.880
Please go back to Apo.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.320
Everyone, let's hurry.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360
Yes, Auntie!

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.560
This way.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.440
What are you doing, M.R. Ya?

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.280
There's been a problem.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.930
Huh?

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.840
It's almost the auspicious time.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.800
I wonder how Apo's doing.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.080
Chan!

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.280
- Yes?
- Can you stall Father and the tycoon?

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.860
- Huh?
- Don't let them see Apo

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.760
before the ceremony!

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.720
Understood?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.920
Wait, Ya...

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.920
Ya!

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.080
He must be incredibly thrilled.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.760
I think he might need your support.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.640
Quite so!

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.480
Then, I'll stop by and give him some.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.320
Tycoon Meng,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.600
Father.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.160
What lovely weather today.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.720
How about...

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.800
we go grab some coffee?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.080
Uh...

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.600
What a day from hell!

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.360
I might get caught,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.080
and now I might have my mind read, too?

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.440
I want to just run away!

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.160
Who's that?

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.420
It's Tailah.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.640
Can I come in?

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.840
Go ahead.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.720
It's almost time for the ceremony.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.200
Are you ready?

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.800
Mm, I am.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.160
If you want to run away from this place,

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.360
you can just tell me.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.880
Maybe later.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.840
Let's go, Tycoon Meng.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.880
I...

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.560
I have a question about this stock.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.960
I noticed the crash in the market.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.480
Hey...

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.600
We're gonna need hours

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.520
to discuss this stock.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.720
- Right.
- How about this?

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.360
Tonight, after the party is over,

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.520
I will give you a thorough explanation.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:32.920
Sure thing.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.320
- Let's go, Tycoon Meng.
- Alright.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.520
Uh,

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.520
I have another question, sir.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.370
I'd like to know if you've seen...

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.080
Why are you...

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.470
asking that?

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.440
Oh...

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.200
Nothing.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.040
I just heard that

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.800
on the big day,

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.600
brides and grooms get overwhelmed
with excitement, anxiety, and confusion.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800
Sometimes,

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.640
they just want to run
from the wedding

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.040
because...

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.960
once it's done,
there's no turning back.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.120
So,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.360
if you want to run away,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
just tell me.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.880
I'll take you.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.360
Don't worry.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.760
No matter what,
I'm right by your side.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.320
You can count on me.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.240
After this, there's no turning back?

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.560
Mm.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.560
Take my hand, okay?

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.920
Before this,
there was a leaked video of this actor,

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.760
and they were
Y MART's ambassador for a while.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.560
I don't think this is the right time
to talk about this.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.680
What's going on with you?

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.400
You're acting strange.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.840
Well,

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.040
there's nothing strange here.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.200
If so, then cut it.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.440
Tycoon Meng's going to see his son.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.400
Don't ruin the auspicious moment, okay?

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.360
This way, Tycoon Meng.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.360
I'm sorry,

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.160
but I promised him.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.560
I can't just leave him.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.270
If I did,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.840
what would people say about him?

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.070
There are people

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.400
who look down on him.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.240
He's gonna...

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.200
be really sad.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.840
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.040
Can I have
a private time with my fiance?

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.240
Where did you find it?

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.160
In the hallway.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.480
Come on, let me put it on.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.960
Just follow my lead.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.240
Come rain or shine,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.800
I promise

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.440
I won't ever leave you alone.
