Mom.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.680
What is it?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.720
Blood.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.640
Please take care of my baby.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.920
Go now, hurry!

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.600
Venerable monk...

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.600
Venerable monk.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.200
Please take this boy under your care.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.480
Your life won’t be an easy one.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.200
You must endure.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.760
Make it through whatever comes.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.040
You’ll see things you wish you hadn’t.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.680
You’ll hear,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.120
things you never wanted to hear.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.360
From now on, your name is,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.920
Thup.

(25 years later)

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.760
We’ve found code 241,
total of seven victims.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.079
At the abandoned mall.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.640
Requesting units 30
and 40 to inspect the scene.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400
Alright, enough.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.880
- I got the call.
- I’ll check it out myself.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.280
Yeah, go see who’s here.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.880
Excuse me, sir.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.640
This is a crime scene,
outsiders aren’t allowed in.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.800
P’Tle, P’Tle.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.360
This is Inspector Singha
from Special Investigation.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.640
He just got transferred back.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.760
Good to see you, sir.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.800
Hello.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.640
First day and you’re already on duty, huh?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.480
- Let’s go.
- This way, please.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480
Sing.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.560
I’ve called forensics, they’re on their way.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.360
- Open it up.
- Okay.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.760
Bring Sey and Darin here.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.920
Got it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.480
Good morning.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560
Told you not to get close while working.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.880
We’re coworkers.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.160
How can I not?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.160
And another thing,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.040
I’m your boss, remember?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.280
Damn you.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720
P’Kem.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.160
You ever seen something like this before?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.840
- Seven bodies?
- Yeah.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.920
Never seen seven at once.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.560
Rough first day for you, Inspector.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.600
Sey.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.080
I’m serious about this one.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.080
Don’t touch anything unless you have to.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.159
Why not?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.360
Look around.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360
Everything here feels... off.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.240
If something bad sticks to you, then what?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.400
You’re talking nonsense.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.920
Oh, Captain Mek! Hello.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.960
Hello.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.320
You’re handling this case yourself?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.840
Not really.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.840
The returning inspector’s in charge.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.040
Showing up this late and keeping me
and forensics waiting,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.240
That’s not right, is it?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.640
Singha.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.120
Yeah?

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.240
How’ve you been?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.960
I’m good, sir.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.800
Dr. Sey, Dr. Darin ,
you may begin the autopsy.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.000
Sing.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.440
Welcome back.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.880
Yeah.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.880
Glad we’re working together again.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.600
It’s been two years already.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.160
I actually missed this kind of pressure.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.200
Two years and your mouth’s still the same.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.240
Darin.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.760
Sing.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.480
Over here, please.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.400
I’ll be right back.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.560
Please look after my uncle for me.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.040
Sure thing.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.560
Sir.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.800
Inspector Singha is in charge of this case.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.680
Forensics and the medical team
are collecting evidence, sir.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.080
Relax, no need for formalities.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.560
I’m counting on you.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.640
Yes, sir.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.720
I’ve ordered the press to stay back.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.960
And also...

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.960
the entire area’s been sealed off.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.400
I want this handled...

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.920
as quietly as possible.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.200
Most importantly,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.560
close this case as fast as you can.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.240
Yes, sir.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.360
Yes, sir. Female, middle-aged.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.280
Average build, fair yellowish skin.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.320
Facial area shows stitched wounds.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.960
A rope was found around the neck.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.760
It circles twice, forming two loops.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.600
Tied with a non-sliding knot.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.240
Behind the right ear area.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.720
Come here.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.240
I know you’re waiting for the lab results
and the full report.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.000
But can you give me a rough estimate?

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.760
From the smell, sir,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.760
this body’s been dead no more than two days.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.480
But the others,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.360
some have been dead for at least five days.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.000
Each victim,

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.320
has been dead for more than 24 hours.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.280
And they didn’t all die the same way.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.280
So they might not have died
at the same time.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.320
Is that right?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.480
Yes, sir.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.640
No signs of struggle found.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.800
The murder and assault,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.920
most likely didn’t happen here.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.840
All victims were probably killed elsewhere.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.240
Then dragged here and hung afterward.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.840
The killer probably
dragged all seven bodies in.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.920
Then hoisted them up one by one.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.000
But as for the details,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.240
I’ll confirm everything again in the lab.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.480
Why go through all that trouble?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.320
Sewing, hanging...

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.000
This isn’t something ordinary.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.799
I think...

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.039
it’s definitely connected
to the supernatural.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.680
Or maybe...

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.840
- ghosts.
- Darin.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.640
You’re talking nonsense.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.960
What kind of ghost kills people,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.520
stitches their eyes and mouths shut,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.680
then hangs them up?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.400
The killer’s human, for sure.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.280
Still, Sing, this case,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.240
it really feels strange.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.280
I felt it the moment I walked in.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.280
And after seeing the bodies,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.360
I got chills all over.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.440
In all my years as a cop,
I’ve never seen anything like this.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.680
If it’s not some deranged psycho,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.280
then maybe Dr. Darin’s right.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.080
You too, Mek?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.320
Stop!

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.080
Stop!

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.280
Police!

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.520
I said stop!

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.000
(Chanting softly)
Phut-thang kancha, Tham-mang kancha,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.200
Sangkhang kancha, nara nacha,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.440
Phuttha khun-nang, Thamma khun-nang,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.880
Sankha khun-nang.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.040
Phut-thang kancha,
Tham-mang kancha, Sangkhang kancha,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.080
Nara nacha.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.920
Phuttha khun-nang,
Thamma khun-nang, Sankha khun-nang.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.200
Hey!

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.920
Who the hell are you?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.480
What are you doing here?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.080
They’re all gone, aren’t they?

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.800
What’s gone? Speak clearly.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.760
Want me to get you drug tested first?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.240
You high or something?

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.080
Cooperate with me, will you?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.000
What were you doing?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.280
You’re covered in blood.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.320
How long have you been here?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.280
Are you messing with me?

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.160
Come here. Come.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.600
Move.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.520
- What’s up, Sing?
- Mek.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.560
Have forensics sweep
the entire building for clues.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.840
And take this guy in for questioning.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.120
But I don’t know anything, officer!

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.080
Why are you taking me in?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.680
You’re the only one found at the scene.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.160
You’re covered in blood.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.640
You ran from the police
and dodged every question.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.440
Who else am I supposed
to suspect if not you?

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.080
You are a suspect in a murder case.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.200
You have the right to remain silent or speak.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.080
Anything you say
may be used as evidence in court.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.200
But I swear, officer,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.480
I had nothing to do
with those hanging bodies!

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.520
I didn’t do it, I swear!

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.400
Facts,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.960
are what will prove everything.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.200
Take him away.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.040
I didn’t do it.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.320
If you didn’t,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.600
then who did?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.800
Ghosts.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.200
Ghosts did it.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.920
You’re saying ghosts did all this?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.480
Yes.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.800
I really saw a ghost!
What else do you want me to say?

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.200
If you’re really innocent,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.480
then cooperate with the investigation.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.360
Soon we’ll find out,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.160
whether you’re a witness,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.000
or the killer.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.720
Mek.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.680
Get forensics to collect his DNA.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.880
Got it, sir.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.280
Where are you taking me?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.640
Come on. Why are you arresting me?

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.680
Sit down.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.520
Stay here for now.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.440
Until the blood test results come back.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.080
- Uh, officer,
- Hey, hey.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.160
Is there another cell available?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.400
Sit down.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.680
Sit.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.840
Anywhere but this room, please.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.920
Please.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.680
You think this is
a five-star hotel? Sit down.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.480
Unlock it.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.280
Alright, give me your hand.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.760
Don’t cause any trouble.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.160
Sing, leaving him like
that isn’t a good idea.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.960
Honestly, he doesn’t look
like a criminal at all.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.360
He might just be unstable or maybe,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.800
You’re saying he actually saw a ghost?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.600
Are you crazy?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.200

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.240
Officer, please help me!

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.280
Officer!

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.000
There’s a ghost inside!

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.800
Get me out of here!

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.640
Officer!

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.160
Get out, what’s wrong with you?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.960
Please, I’m begging you,
get me out of here.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560
Anywhere else is fine.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.200
There’s a ghost in here!

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.520
- Mek.
- Yes, sir.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.640
Take him away.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.320
Please, officer, put me somewhere else!

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.920
If you can’t wait quietly
for the lab results,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.040
then go in for questioning.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.040
- Bring him in.
- Move.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.480
This video will be used as evidence.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.960
for the suspect’s investigation record.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.280
Thamawat Santasakol.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.160
Age 25, from Sisaket.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.000
How long have you been in Bangkok?

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.360
Where’s your family?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.280
Uh...

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.240
It’s kind of a long story.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.760
You think I’m asking for fun?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.720
Answer me.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.680
I grew up in a temple.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.560
I’ve lived with a monk since I was a kid.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.040
After he passed away,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.840
I moved to Bangkok.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.560
To work and support myself.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.720
What kind of work?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.640
I’m a freelance illustrator.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.280
Then what were you doing in the mall?

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.360
Illustrators don’t just wander
into abandoned malls at night.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.200
Not to draw something, that’s for sure.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.880
If I tell you,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.360
you’ll just think I’m crazy again.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.480
But I’m telling the truth.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.640
Deciding what’s true,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.240
that’s my job.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.320
You just give me the facts.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.000
So what were you doing
at the abandoned mall?

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.800
A few nights ago,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.360
I had a dream...

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.600
that something terrible
would happen there.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.280
It felt so real.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.080
You’re saying a ghost sent you that dream?

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.400
But...

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.560
the dream I saw,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.120
it felt like I’d seen it before.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.880
So I took a taxi and went there.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.000
And then?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.000
After I got there,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.800
I walked inside.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.800
And I saw a tree, just like in my dream.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.400
And seven bodies hanging from it.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.680
If you really saw the bodies,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.280
and you were that scared,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.280
why didn’t you leave?

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.960
Just seeing them hanging there,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.680
I completely lost it.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.480
And then there was...

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.280
uh...

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.200
wandering spirits.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.240
(Chanting)
Phut-thang kancha, Tham-mang kancha...

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.880
That’s when I ran into you, Inspector.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.400
Right now,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.640
you’re a suspect in a mass murder case.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.680
If you keep talking nonsense like this,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.800
there’s no way you’ll get out of it.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.920
But I swear, officer, I didn’t do it!

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.400
How can you accuse me of that?

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.240
Without solid evidence,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.000
I can’t release you.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160
Take him back to his cell.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.680
I’m not going back in that room!

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.680
Sir, please, I’m not going back in there!

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.800
You,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960
so damn fussy.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Someone hanged themselves
in that room, right?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.040
Whoever stays in there,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.360
ends up hanging themselves too.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.000
I don’t want to be next.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.040
That room,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.880
someone really did hang themselves there.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.080
And every suspect kept in it,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.240
ended up hanging themselves too.

(POLICE CAPTAIN SINGHA WETARAK)

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.360
Stay in here for now.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.920
Don’t cause any trouble, got it?

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.280
Yes, sir.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.240
I promise I’ll stay quiet.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.440
I won’t go anywhere until
the blood results are back.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.560
The only reason I put you here,

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.680
is so you don’t bother anyone else.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.560
Yes, sir. And…

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.600
what happens next?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.240
You can only hold me for 48 hours, right?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.920
So you know the law too, huh?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.680
Why?

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.360
Planning to run?

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.920
Why would I run, sir?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.280
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.800
You’re not,

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.360
the kind of cop who arrests
innocent people, right?

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.960
Once the lab results are out, we’ll know,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.800
if your DNA’s on the bodies or not.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.360
Inspector Singha.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.200
Commander Yuth is asking for you, urgent.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.080
Okay.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.600
The suspect apprehended at the scene,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.320
the report says,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.200
there was only one suspect, right?

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.920
Yes, sir.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.000
I’ve already questioned him, sir.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.080
Most likely just a local from the area.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.280
We might have to keep him
as a witness for now.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.360
Listen.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.680
We can’t overlook something like that.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.280
He could be the real killer.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.080
I understand, sir.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.960
I’m still questioning him.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.520
But we can’t jump to
conclusions without evidence.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.600
Look,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.200
The higher-ups are pressing us now.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.800
They want this case
cleared as soon as possible.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.880
You know,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.480
who owns the land at
that construction site, right?

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.200
And what they plan to build there.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.520
Yes, I’m aware.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.200
Good.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.080
So if you’re going to investigate
or make an arrest,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.120
do it as fast as you can.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.280
Because right now,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.280
I’ve already signed the order
for a special task force.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.800
You’ll be leading that team.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.840
Yes, sir.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.880
I’ll find the real killer
as quickly as possible.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.920
But I think you already know,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.360
If you can’t close this case quickly,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.080
you might end up being transferred back.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.200
Understood, sir.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.960
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.520
Hello?

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.840
Sing.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.320
Darin and I just finished the autopsies.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.520
But the DNA results aren’t in yet.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.640
You coming here yourself or,

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.440
Yeah, I’ll head over.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.320
Both eyes show stitching marks.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.440
Same for the mouth.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.800
Rope marks found around the neck.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.840
Another long, consistent wound was found,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.840
with a diameter of about 0.5 millimeters.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.280
The entire body was covered in bruises.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.000
Estimated time of death: one to two days.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.600
The stitching on the mouth
and eyes was postmortem.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.400
The stitches were messy and uneven.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.680
But there were no signs of struggle.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.520
What’s stranger is,

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.480
we detected GHB.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.280
Commonly known as
a date-rape drug, in every victim.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.800
This drug,

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.840
suppresses brain function.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.800
It suppresses respiration,
causing loss of consciousness.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.000
So the drug was used on every victim.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.200
And aside from that,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.800
is there any connection
between the seven victims?

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.720
No physical similarities whatsoever.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.120
Different genders, different ages.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.160
But this one, is a transgender victim.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.680
What about time of death?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.120
We can’t determine the exact time yet.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.720
But what we do know,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.600
is that every body,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.560
died at different times.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.480
All seven were murdered using wire,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.480
and thin rope.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.480
After that, their eyes were sewn shut,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.840
and their mouths too.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.200
Then their bodies were hanged from the tree.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.400
The killer must’ve been very strong,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.960
to do all that alone.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.800
At this point, I’m not even sure,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.800
how many killers we’re dealing with.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.560
And the blood-stained shirt,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.440
from the suspect at the scene?

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.440
The DNA doesn’t match any of the victims.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.240
It’s his own blood.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.440
Wake up.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.160
Comfortable, huh?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.200
Wake up.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.120
Oh, you’re back already?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.680
Put your arm on the table.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.600
Or do you want that wound infected?

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.600
Give me your hand.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.480
Your hand.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.600
You got a nickname?

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.840
Thup, sir.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.400
Thup.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.880
Fits a temple kid just right.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.480
So, you always talk about ghosts like this?

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.000
I don’t like talking about them.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.200
I actually hate ghosts.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.240
But when I say that,
you’ll just scold me again.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.520
So tell me,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.280
you think you’ve seen ghosts since birth?

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.400
Didn’t you say you don’t believe in ghosts?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.280
What if I did?

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.880
When did you start seeing them?

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.840
Since as far back as I can remember.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.320
When I was living with Luang Pu,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.720
I couldn’t see any ghosts.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.080
I only started seeing them
after he passed away.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.000
Why don’t you wear an amulet?

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.480
Do you worship anything?

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.400
People scared of ghosts usually do, right?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.400
It doesn’t help anymore.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.280
Not since my master passed.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.160
I’ve lost all hope since then.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.440
Could you stop acting so pathetic?

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.880
Ow.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.280
Why’re you tensing up?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.280
I’m just putting on ointment.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.120
I’m not tense.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.120
I’m cold.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.120
Sir.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.200
Sing.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.040
Black coffee, no sugar as usual.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.720
Ah, thanks.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.760
It’s your first day back at work,

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.200
and you already got a big case.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.640
You’re not thinking of quitting,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.880
and transferring back to Prachin, right?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.400
I never quit. Not my style.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.280
Good thing you’re still here, though.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.480
Would’ve been tough without you.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.400
I’m glad you’re back too, sir.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.320
Working with you always
gets my adrenaline up.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.480
Still as cheeky as ever, huh?

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.960
Just a little, sir.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.600
Hey, Sing.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.800
That taxi driver sounded just like Thup.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.440
His statement and the DNA results match.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.200
So that kid, Thup,

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.040
is just a witness in this case.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.360
Yeah.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.440
But right now,

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.040
where the hell do we start finding clues?

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.720
Or maybe it’s a ghost.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.680
Like Thup said, right?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.120
You want me to write in the report

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.400
that everything happened
because of a ghost?

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.600
Yes, sir.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.120
Sir, it’s loud in your office!

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.040
That kid Thup’s freaking out again!

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.600
You’d better come quick!

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.120
Okay.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.920
Buddhang ganja, Dhammang ganja,
Sanghang ganja...

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.080
Narara nacha, Buddha khunnang,
Dhamma khunnang, Sangha khunnang...

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.720
Please don’t come closer, I’m scared!

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.200
Don’t hurt me!

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.240
Get out!

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.120
Go!

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480
Thup.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.040
Thup, it’s me.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.080
Sir...

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.600
The ghost’s about to break my neck!

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.320
If you don’t let go of me,

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.000
I’ll be the one to break your neck!

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.360
You’re pretty strong this time.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.679
- Why’re you yelling?
- The ghost tricked me!

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.920
I’m serious, sir!

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.719
It’s right there by the window!

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.360
You’re saying all this was the ghost’s doing?

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.280
Stop making up stories.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.239
And stay quiet.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.199
Or I’ll cuff you again, got it?

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.280
Sir, I think...

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.840
I can’t stay in this room anymore.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.120
What now?

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.480
You won’t stay in that room,

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.159
and you can’t stay in mine either.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.719
So what do you want exactly?

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.760
Maybe it’s...

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.719
not about the place.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.280
It’s more about me.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.920
Then...

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.200
can I stay with you, sir?

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.280
Please, I'm begging you.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.320
Please.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.760
When I'm with you, sir

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.360
the ghost disappears.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.120
You’re my talisman, like my master.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.760
Can I stay with you too, sir?

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.280
Me? A holy thing?

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.760
I'm human.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.840
I don't know.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.160
But I think ghosts must fear you.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.120
Legally speaking,

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.240
I'm still presumed innocent.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.680
The police have no evidence against me.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.640
You're a cop,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.200
so protect the innocent.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.880
Sing.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.600
He's right about that, Sing.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.480
Also, the DNA test confirmed

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.280
it doesn't match any body.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.000
I'm warning you.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.080
If you're coming with me,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.480
don't be a nuisance.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.760
Don't cause trouble.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.000
And most importantly,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.640
don't even think of running.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.920
Got it?

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.800
Yes, of course, sir.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.960
Helmet on.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.720
Come here.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.680
Get on.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.240
Or do you want me to carry you?

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.640
Uh, no need, sir.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.280
Hold on to me.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.280
Hold tight.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.160
If you fall off,

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.640
I’m not taking responsibility.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.680
You sleep downstairs.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.600
There’s only one bed upstairs.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.800
You can take the sofa, right?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.680
If you let me sleep on the floor,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.680
I’d still be fine at this point.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.280
You and that mouth of yours.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.960
Give me that.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.280
Wait here. I’ll be back.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.280
Lights are broken.
Deal with it for now.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.000
Go shower and change.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.400
You look like

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.080
a stray dog.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.200
Thanks for taking me in, even temporarily.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.720
This isn’t a shelter, kid.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.200
Thank you, sir.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.560
Call me Singha.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.560
Huh?

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.480
From now on, call me Singha.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.600
Hearing “sir” outside the station’s annoying.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.600
Alright.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.680
P’Singha.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.840
Bathroom’s over there.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.920
No wonder.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.760
When I’m near P’Singha, the ghost vanishes.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.920
It’s because of you.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.240
Please protect me too, sir.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.080
Thup.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.120
- Whoa,
- Thup!

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.840
What the hell are you doing?

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.120
Uh, I’m sorry, sir,

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.400
I mean, P’Singha!

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.600
I didn’t mean to.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.600
You blew the power?

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.640
I just...

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.120
plugged in the fish tank and it shorted.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.800
Now the whole house went dark.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.480
I told you not to cause trouble!

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.080
I’m sorry!

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.600
But please don’t yell at me yet.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.200
Shouldn’t you put some clothes on first?

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.880
Mind your own business.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.040
I’m not cold.
I could stay shirtless all day.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.680
But I’m cold just looking at you.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.560
I told you to take a shower.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.680
So do it.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.800
It’s annoying when you don’t listen.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.120
And one more thing,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.520
I didn’t ask you to renovate my house.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.480
I just don’t want to be a burden.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.400
Can I at least help with chores?

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.880
So you won’t kick me out.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.960
No need.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.800
That kind of work,

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.680
I save it for my wife.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.120
Your wife?

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.600
And lastly,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.760
Stop causing trouble.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.600
Go to sleep.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.800
P’Singha.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.800
If I see something, can I go upstairs to you?

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.280
Don’t even think

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.720
about bothering me.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.600
Wow...

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.280
Thup.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.320
Thup.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.040
You sleep like the dead, huh?

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.680
Who told you to act like it’s your own house?

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.320
Thup.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.120
Thup, wake up.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.600
Thup.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.280
Oh.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.200
Good morning, P’Singha.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.120
Get dressed already.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.400
You sleep all over the place.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.360
Here, get dressed.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.800
Wear mine for now.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.680
I was planning to wake up early
and make you breakfast.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.080
But I kinda overslept.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.800
Don’t bother.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.240
I might end up poisoned
and hanging from a tree.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.280
Honestly,

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.320
I seem way more likable than you are.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.440
Cut the whining already.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.880
After you, P’Singha.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.880
P’Singha, wait here for a sec, okay?

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.400
Don’t go anywhere.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.800
I’ll just grab my clothes real quick.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.080
What are you, three?

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.160
You that scared I’ll leave you?

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.320
Just a second.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.680
Yeah.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.240
Let’s go.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.400
How long are you planning
to stay at my place?

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.560
It’s temporary, not permanent.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.840
Better extra than not enough, right?

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.720
Hurry up, we’ve got a lot of stops to make.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.680
Aren’t we going back to your house?

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.040
We are.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.600
But we need to stop somewhere first.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.680
Why are we here?

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.720
We’re reconstructing the scene.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.200
Show me how it happened.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.920
What exactly went down yesterday.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.240
Thup.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.160
I’m trying to help you here.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.280
Even if there’s no victim DNA on you,

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.680
you’re still the only one who was here.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.960
You can’t fully clear yourself as a suspect.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.680
So what do I have to do,

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.320
to finally be free from this?

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.720
If you don’t wanna be
the scapegoat, start talking.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.240
Alright then.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.960
But P’Singha, you have to let me hold you.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.120
What?

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.000
Hold you?

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.320
Because ghosts are scared of you.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.040
I can show you what happened.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.000
But let me hold onto you for a bit.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.800
Ghosts fear me, huh?

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.520
Alright.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.080
Do whatever you need to do.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.600
Uh...

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.320
I walked in from that direction.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.160
Then I came across this tree.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.080
It looked exactly like in my dream.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.360
There were...

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.280
incense sticks, candles,
and trays scattered everywhere.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.480
When I looked up,

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.560
I saw seven bodies
hanging right here, P’Singha.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.000
Then...

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.120
after that...

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.080
What is it?

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.880
There’s...

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.080
Thup, I don’t have all day.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.800
P’Singha...

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.920
I think this place used to be a cemetery.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.080
A cemetery?

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.240
What cemetery are you talking about?

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.280
Yesterday...

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.160
When I first met you here,

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.800
I...

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.760
I saw so many wandering spirits around.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.080
And what does that have to do with anything?

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.440
This place is overflowing
with spiritual energy.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.080
I’m afraid that

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.960
the bodies dumped here...

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.000
were part of a ritual sacrifice.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.680
A sacrifice to feed spirits.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.280
To gain even more power.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.120
Usually, the people who do this

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.480
practice dark magic or witchcraft.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.320
They make deals with ghosts,

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.400
so the ghosts do what they want.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.600
Wait,

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.960
Make deals with ghosts?

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.040
You’re saying they sacrifice bodies

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.720
to command the spirits?

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.280
Yes, sir.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.000
Okay.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.880
What is it?

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.960
Sing,

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.800
Get back to the station now.
Something big’s happened.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.600
Alright.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.800
Yes, sir.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.680
What I’d like to say is that the police

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.400
are doing everything we can on this case.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.720
We’d like everyone to trust

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.200
that this case isn’t anything special,

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.600
nothing strange,

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.600
unlike what the news has been spinning.

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.120
Then to keep the reports consistent,

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.400
who’s leading this case, sir?

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.000
Since this is a major investigation,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.400
the person overseeing it

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.280
has to be the best in our unit.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.920
Who’s that?

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.680
- Oh...
- Inspector King.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.120
Why Inspector King?

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.960
Therefore, I’ve appointed Inspector King,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.800
Lieutenant Colonel Wachira Kongthampipat,

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.720
as the lead investigator
for this special case.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.320
So that means Inspector King
will handle the whole case?

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.640
- Yes, of course.
- That’s right.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.320
Have you found any new evidence?

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.560
Yes, any leads?

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.000
Or do you have any direction
for the investigation, Inspector?

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.160
Anything new to share?

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.000
Close this case as fast as possible.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.720
That’s why headquarters sent
Inspector King to assist.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.840
Our unit can handle this ourselves.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.160
So what connects these seven victims?

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.840
There’s no connection at all.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.760
Then what’s the motive behind it?

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.160
This looks like a black magic case to me.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.400
It’s called a serial murder case, genius.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.760
Help!

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.120
Five years ago in Sisaket,

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.640
ten years ago in Phang Nga,

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.840
five years ago in Chiang Mai,

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.960
and now Bangkok.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.160
The reason I let him stay here

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.960
is for his own safety.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.680
(This is real, no stunt doubles.)
No stand-ins here, folks.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.480
(*All characters seen are dummies.)
The setup’s seriously massive.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.640
- What the heck is this?
- Work.

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.880
Cut.
(Just watching makes me tired.)

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.680
Walkie one to walkie two,
come see the lovebirds.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.680
Who are you? What are you doing here?

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.160
(What are you up to, Singha?)

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.480
- Done already?
- Done.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.920
They’re gone.
(Otto hasn’t even filmed yet!)
