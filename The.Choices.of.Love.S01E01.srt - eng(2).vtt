00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.480
Let’s celebrate our On-the-Rise
Company of the Year Award!

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.800
Where’s the boss?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.960
The boss? Over there.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.960
I’m here!

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.680
I'm so hot. Are you hot?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.640
- Woo!
- Of course.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.000
I’m even more effervescent than
this soda!

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400
May.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.280
May!

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.200
What are you doing on the table?
Come down. You'll fall.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.680
Come on, Pat.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.040
Aren’t you feeling unwell? You said
you were going home early.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280
I’ll leave soon.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.120
You should go. Don’t worry.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560
Leave with me now.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
It’s late.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.920
And the air’s bad.
You’ll get sick again. Let's go.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.080
What? Fine, I’ll go.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640
Let me take you home.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.080
No, I’ll go by myself.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.600
Seriously, Pat...

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.880
I’m not drunk. I haven't had a drop.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.960
I’m just enjoying hanging out
with everyone.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.760
You should head home.
I’ll go by myself.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.560
Pass me my purse.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.360
Drink as much as you want,
I’ve already paid.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.080
Get home safe, May.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
May.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.880
Check the traffic light, will you?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.360
Go get
your driver’s license already.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
May.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.640
May, open the door.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
May.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.160
Are you okay? Did you hit your head?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360
Did you just black out?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.960
I’m fine, Pat.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.720
You’re not drunk, are you?

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.680
Then why did you almost
run a red light?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Should I call an ambulance?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.400
Can you not make a big deal of it?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.520
It was just a small accident.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.120
Why are you freaking out so much?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.120
Of course I’m freaking out.
I’m worried about you.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.720
The doctor told you to rest,
but you wouldn’t.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.280
You stayed up all night working
and then went out partying.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.440
How could I not be worried?

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.840
Pat, I’ve always lived like this.
You never had a problem with it.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.360
So why is it a problem today?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.080
Because I care about you.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960
No, Pat.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.960
We’re just too different.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.800
You know that, don’t you?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.120
Admit the truth. Stop forcing it.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
Let’s break up.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.120
Calm down, May.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320
Pat.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.600
This way, you won’t have to drag
me away from my staff like just now.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.920
May, I'm sorry.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.200
I know you’re only saying this
because you’re mad.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440
I'm sorry.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040
- No, Pat.
- I...

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.520
We're just not compatible.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.080
May.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.800
I won’t say anything again.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.120
I just have one request.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.160
You work too hard,
please take care of yourself.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.800
The doctor warned you about your
health. You need to rest more.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.040
Please, I’m really worried
about you.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
May.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.840
Think about it carefully.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.640
I love you, May.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320
Please calm down.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.400
I really care about you.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.600
I want to take better care of you.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920
May.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
Marry me.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.920
If you don’t answer,
I’ll take that as a yes.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920
Move in with me tomorrow

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.720
so I can take care of you.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720
I love you.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800
I promise

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.680
I’ll take good care of you.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.040
Aoy and Chod, I’ve known Pat
since we were in college.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.800
We’re very different.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.360
No one ever thought we’d work out.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.720
I’m "Sexy May" to my friends,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.360
and Pat is a serious man.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.600
(Three Years Ago)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.360
May.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.760
May.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640
May.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.480
I'll be right back. May.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.520
Pat has always been such a good man
since the day I met him.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.600
Not once has he ever
treated me badly.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280
Pat.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.680
Put me down, I’m fine.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.200
I’m fine, you can let me go now.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.600
Are you sure?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.280
You seemed tired earlier.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.480
I'm sure.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.360
I’m just a little dizzy
because I didn’t get enough sleep.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.080
I had to work at the shooting set
last night.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960
You slept late, didn’t you?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.160
No, I slept in the morning.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.480
You seem to enjoy
doing stuff like this.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.560
You used to pull all-nighters
all the time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Of course.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.360
I only live once,
I have to live it to the fullest.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.560
I don’t want to go to bed at 8 p.m.
like you, that’s too boring.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.400
I’m just worried about you.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.240
Thank you

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.040
for always caring about me,
no matter what.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.560
I’ll feel better
after I go wash my face.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280
May.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.880
I don’t know if I’ll ever see you
again after this graduation party.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.120
I’m sure you know
how I’ve felt about you

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.720
all this time.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680
I like you.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.400
If you’re not seeing anyone,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.080
would you give me a chance?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.360
Sure.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.880
Why don’t we give it a shot?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560
I...

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520
Are you serious?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560
Yes.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.560
I was waiting to see

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.240
when you’d have the courage
to bring this up.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.560
I guess

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.600
you’ve had plenty to drink tonight.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.240
So I decided to date him
for one reason.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.640
He’s always been good to me.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240
Please wait.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.960
Are you tired? Do you want to rest?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.920
We’d like to take a break.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.240
- Of course.
- Thanks.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.600
You’ve been busy, right?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.520
It’s a good thing
you let me handle the wedding.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.440
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of everything.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.400
I just want you to get more rest

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.320
so that you'll look beautiful
at the wedding.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.160
I need to make a call
about the invitations.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.000
Even though Pat is great
and loves me a lot,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.200
I don’t know why,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.160
the closer the wedding gets,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600
the more unsure I feel.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.560
Here's your water.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.760
Thank you.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.160
The photographer will be back soon.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.960
Surprise.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.360
The place looks great, Kit.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.960
People will enjoy this vibe because
they’re not just coming to drink,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.080
they’re coming for the experience

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.440
and to find somewhere nice
to take photos for social media.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.480
You need some colorful signature
drinks for people to show off,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.360
or maybe a live band,
I think that would be nice.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.800
I definitely chose
the right person to consult.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.520
You’re a Comm Arts girl
with a real knack for marketing.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.640
No way. I’m just speaking
from all my experience partying.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.880
I don’t have
a knack for marketing at all.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.080
I’m just a normal customer.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.520
But still, I really did
pick the right person to consult.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.720
You know,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.560
I think

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.360
you and I have a lot in common.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.520
If we put our heads together

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.720
and start a business together,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.320
it could turn out really well.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.200
Besides, I know

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440
how you feel

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.400
about me.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.520
You’re beautiful, brilliant,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.800
and smart.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.280
I like you, May.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120
Kit.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
I...

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.320
I have a boyfriend.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520
You do?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.840
Who’s your boyfriend?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.000
I just agreed to date Pat.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120
Pat?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.720
You're dating Pat?

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.920
I can’t believe plain-old Pat

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.200
is dating a hot girl like Sexy May.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.040
He’s really good to me,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.360
so I wanted to give him a chance.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.360
- I see.
- Well...

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.640
But if you want my advice
on your bar,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360
I’m willing to help.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.520
Thank you.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.080
I’ll get going then.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480
Okay.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.120
How are you, my beautiful girl?

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960
Kit.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.840
You’re back, long time no see.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.640
I came back to Thailand
not long ago.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.640
My partner wanted to take a break,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.800
so I’ll be managing it.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.600
I saw it on my social media feed

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.120
that you're doing your pre-wedding
shoot here, so I wanted to say hi.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.760
And congratulations.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.560
Thank you.
I didn’t think you’d be back.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.680
I’d like to invite you
to our wedding.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.200
I’ll send you an invitation
once they're ready.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.600
Sure. Where’s Pat?

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.520
He’s on the phone.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.840
I see.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.920
I never thought I’d see Sexy May
in a wedding dress.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.880
You look gorgeous.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.800
You’re exaggerating, Kit.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.520
When will I get to go
to your wedding?

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.600
Probably not anytime soon.
I’m single.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.440
- I see.
- I have to go, so I won’t see Pat.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.400
Tell him I said hi. See you then.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Sure.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.440
What a great year for you.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.600
Your advertising agency just won
that On-the-Rise Award,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.080
and you're getting married.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.520
Lucky in game, lucky in love.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800
Congratulations again.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.080
Let me give you a hug.
I’ve missed you.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.080
Congratulations,
my beautiful sister.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520
Thank you.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400
See you.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.520
(Kit)

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080
Yes, Kit?

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400
Am I bothering you?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440
I can talk.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.240
I wanted to ask you
to help promote my bar.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.760
I’m not sure if you’re available.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200
Really?

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.560
I’m happy to help you.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.360
You can drop by my office anytime.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.680
Let’s go somewhere comfortable,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.480
like my bar.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600
Is that okay with you?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600
Well...

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480
I like you, May.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.720
We can decide on the location later.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.320
Thank you for picking up
my call so late.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720
Good night.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080
Bye.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200
May.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.160
- May.
- Yes?

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.520
Hey.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.600
Is everything okay?
You don’t usually lock the door.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.920
I probably locked it by accident.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.240
I just finished my work,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.040
so I wanted to help my bride-to-be

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400
choose the pre-wedding photos.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.040
I can’t let you do that alone.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440
Okay.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080
Come sit with me.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.400
When we were taking these photos

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.000
and I saw you in a wedding dress,

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.480
I was so happy.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.200
It made me realize
I made the right decision

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.680
when I asked you to date me
at the graduation party.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880
I made the right decision.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.360
I love you.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.200
Which photos do you like?

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.640
This one’s cute.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440
I agree.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.560
I really picked the right person
to consult again.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.800
You gave great advice
on my bar’s promotion plan.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.160
I’m not surprised at all
that your company

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.800
won the On-the-Rise Award
in just three years.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.800
You’re amazing.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880
Thank you, Kit.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.440
Today,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.520
you look so pretty.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.080
Do you always dress up this nicely
to meet your clients?

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480
Of course.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.920
They wouldn't call me Sexy May

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.600
if I didn't look this hot.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.240
You're right.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.200
I’m so jealous of Pat.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.400
He’s one lucky guy

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.640
to have a beautiful lady like you.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.760
Your wedding is coming up.
I wish you both happiness.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.280
If I were Pat, I’d be so worried,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.600
having such a fabulous girlfriend

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.720
who’s so different from him,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200
who’s so plain.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.280
Sorry, I’m probably saying too much
because I’ve had a few drinks.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.480
It’s okay. You’re right.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.880
When I’m with Pat,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.280
I feel like we’re so different.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240
I...

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840
Here.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.480
This is our invitation.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.320
I’d like to officially invite you.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240
Okay.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560
Congratulations again.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.040
You probably have so much
on your mind.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.280
You’ve given me advice
so many times.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.560
If you ever want to talk to me,
I’m happy to listen.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.520
Thank you.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600
Well...

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.960
I'll get going then.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.440
Get home safely.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080
Yes, Pat?

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.800
I thought you said
you wouldn’t be home late.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.800
I’m on my way home.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.520
Are you drunk?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.640
Can you drive?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.120
Do you want me to pick you up?

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.080
It’s okay, Pat. Don’t worry.
See you at home.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.280
May.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.280
May.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.040
May.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640
May.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.560
May, get up slowly.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360
Excuse me.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960
Are you okay?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960
Call the ambulance.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.560
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600
Are you okay?

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.880
It’s a good thing
you weren’t badly injured.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.560
How did you fall down the stairs?

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.240
I was probably walking too quickly.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840
Why?

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.640
Because you were afraid of Pat?

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.120
I usually see men afraid
of their girlfriends,

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.960
but you’re afraid of a man like Pat?

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.280
I don’t want him to worry too much,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.920
so I just wanted
to get home quickly.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.520
I understand him.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.640
Lately, I’ve been working late
for several days in a row,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.840
until I fainted from exhaustion.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.000
But sometimes,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.560
his worry makes me uncomfortable.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.320
I have a lot of work to do,

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.280
and sometimes I get home late
because I have to attend parties.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.040
It’s necessary because I have to
socialize for work.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.920
I tried to explain it to him,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.600
but it feels like
he just doesn’t get it.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080
But I do.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.320
Like I’ve told you before,
we have a lot in common.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.120
We understand each other
without having to explain.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.760
I think Pat actually understands.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.080
He just worries about you too much.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.560
I think he’ll be here soon.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.040
Do you mind leaving?

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.520
I didn’t tell him I was out
with you, I’m sorry.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.880
It’s okay, I get it.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760
Get well soon.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.520
Excuse me, which room
is Maysa Warakul in?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800
Please wait here.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.880
- Hello, Pat.
- May.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.200
Which room are you in?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.040
- I’m in 302.
- How many times have I told you...

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.760
Where is room 302?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.920
Go this way.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360
Thank you.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.680
How many times must I repeat myself?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.920
This is because you’re a workaholic
and your body can’t handle it.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.680
It’s nothing, Pat.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.600
I was hurrying home to see you,
that’s why I got hurt.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.000
I’ve already explained
my work to you.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.800
I understand.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.280
Is receiving the On-the-Rise Award
worth it? It isn’t.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.440
We’re talking about
your health here.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.440
That means you don’t understand
my work at all.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.840
I’ve explained it to you
so many times.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.720
This is how I work.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.840
It’s never been a problem before,
so why is it a problem now?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.760
I understand,
but do you understand me?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.040
I’m just worried about you,
that’s all.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.640
Do you understand me at all?

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.640
I understand that you’re worried,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.800
but the way you’re acting makes me
really uncomfortable.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.120
We’re just too different, Pat.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.200
After living together,
I realized we don’t get along.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.080
You live a daytime life,
I live a nighttime life.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.320
This is who I am. I can’t change it
because it’s my work.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.720
If we keep living like this,

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.600
you’ll be exhausted because of me,
and I’m not okay with that.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.520
I think

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.520
we should live separately.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.840
- I’ll go back home and you...
- May.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.000
May, calm down.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.760
No.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.080
Why live separately?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.600
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.240
I'm sorry
for making you uncomfortable.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.480
I’m so sorry.
Please don’t go anywhere.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120
I...

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.600
I promise I’ll try
to understand your work.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.680
You have to understand me too,
I’m just worried about you.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.440
That’s it. I’m worried about you.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
I'm serious.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840
Please calm down.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240
May.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560
Walk slowly.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.280
Does it hurt?

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.320
I'm much better now.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.160
But it hurts a little.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240
Slowly.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.240
You need to rest a lot.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.520
I still have so much work to do.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520
May.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.840
I understand that you’re worried
about work,

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.600
but you should worry
about yourself too.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.280
Can you ask someone else
to handle it for now?

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.080
If not, go talk to the clients.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.880
I’m sure they’ll understand,
it’s beyond your control.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.640
Right now, you need to rest.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.600
Sleep and eat more,
so you’ll heal faster.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.320
Once you’ve recovered,
you can go back to work.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.240
Let me know you're hungry,
I’ll get you something to eat.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560
Pat.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.640
Honestly, aren’t you tired of me
being like this?

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.520
Not at all.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.200
You know how much I love you.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.000
I’ll get you something to eat.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280
I'm back.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200
Thank you.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.960
Eat something so you can
take your medicine and rest.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.600
I don’t feel like eating.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.320
Fine, you don’t have to eat now.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800
Do you want to rest?

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360
Okay.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400
Be careful.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.480
- Let me know if it hurts.
- Okay.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.080
Does it hurt?

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800
Okay.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600
Here you go.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
It's still swollen.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800
Does it hurt?

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600
Thank you.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.440
Like I said,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.760
I’ll take care of you.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240
I love you.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.520
Aoy and Chod.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.840
He’s so good to me
it makes me feel guilty.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.440
If I choose to leave
someone who loves me,

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.840
I'd feel sorry for him,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.920
and I’d regret it too.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.480
Did you send the first draft
to the client?

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.600
Please update me.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520
Okay.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.640
- Hello, Pat?
- Are you free this evening?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.920
I want to take you out for dinner.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.240
We haven’t eaten out in a while.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.720
I got my paycheck today. It’s on me.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.400
Tell me what you want to eat.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.080
I’m busy today.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.920
Maybe next time?

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400
Really?

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.280
Sure, it's fine.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.760
We can go next time.
You can just work today.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280
Pat.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.880
Would it be okay

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.560
if we go at 8 or 9 p.m. today?

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120
Of course.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.920
That’s fine with me.
I’ll wait for you.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.360
There’s no need to rush.
Take your time.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.640
Okay, I’ll call you after work.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.080
Sure, I’ll hang up now.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.760
Good luck.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.720
Nicky, did the client give us
any feedback?

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.080
Tomorrow?

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.840
Okay, then we don’t have to stay
and make any edits.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920
Thank you.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840
Is receiving

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.120
the On-the-Rise Award worth
sacrificing your health?

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.920
It's not worth it at all.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.160
Surprise.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.480
Kit.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.280
This is why I like surprising you.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.320
You look so funny
when you’re surprised.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600
Congratulations.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.800
I’d like to officially
congratulate you on your award.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.240
Thank you so much.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560
I got you this too.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.560
I think you’ll like this more
than the bouquet.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Thank you.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.800
Wow, your office looks amazing.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.720
Not just anyone can do this.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.000
Besides being skilled,
you have to be dedicated

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.080
to build your own company

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.840
and win this On-the-Rise Award
within three years.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.040
I can see

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.440
how much this award means to you.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.000
Thank you so much.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.920
Are you free?

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.160
I want to consult you
about my bar’s promotion plan.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.440
Sure, I’m done for today.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.920
Would you like to have a drink
while we talk? I’m fine with it.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.480
Well...

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.640
I usually don’t let my staff
drink at the office,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.400
but rules are meant to be broken.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.360
Don’t be too serious about it.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.240
Wait, you have
wine glasses in your office?

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.480
I was joking earlier.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.840
But I’m serious.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.480
My staff will leave soon.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.520
We can have a few drinks.
It should be fine.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.320
How long has it been since
we had such a fun talk?

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.280
Ever since you moved abroad.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800
No.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.400
Ever since

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.440
you started dating Pat.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.360
(Pat)

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.400
Excuse me.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.560
Pat.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.040
I’m sorry. I was busy at work
and I forgot we had a date.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.200
I knew you’d forget our dinner date.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.080
You probably forgot to eat too.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.960
I came by to drop off some food.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.240
Where are you?

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.440
I’m in front of your office.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800
What?

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.680
May.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.120
May.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.720
Kit, do you mind waiting here?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.680
If Pat sees you,
we’ll have a problem.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.880
May.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.960
- Pat.
- May.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.960
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.960
I wasn’t free anymore.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680
Wait.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440
Were you drinking?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.240
Well...

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.880
I had a drink with the team.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.400
You just fell down the stairs
and the doctor said no drinking.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.960
Why did you do that?

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.120
I think you might be an alcoholic.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.160
May, you're at the office.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.040
You drink at parties, and now you’re
drinking here. I’m not okay with it.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.280
Pat.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.800
Let some things be my business.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.640
How could you say that?

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.360
I’m just worried about you.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.640
Pat, I'm fine.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.280
This is my office.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.520
If you don’t support
or understand what I do,

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.200
then at least let me do what I want.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.840
It's not like that.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.200
It’s not that I don’t support you.
I’m just worried.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.440
Leave me alone.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.880
Do you realize

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.160
you’re making me
more and more uncomfortable, Pat?

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.560
Give me some space to breathe.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.000
Leave. If you don’t leave,
I’ll never speak to you again.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200
I'm sorry

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960
for making you uncomfortable.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040
I'll leave.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680
Here's your food.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920
I'm worried about you.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.040
I’m sorry
for making you wait so long.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.760
I waited for him to get in the car
and actually leave.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.520
It's fine.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520
I understand.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.400
Did you get into a fight with him

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640
because of me?

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.760
No, Kit.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.880
I don’t know what’s gotten into him.
He always makes me uncomfortable.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.800
I think we should call it a night.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.560
No.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.360
You’re uncomfortable
and got into a fight with him

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.120
because you’re the only
one adjusting.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.240
I heard him say
he’s worried about you,

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.120
but I don’t see him
adjusting to you.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.520
Why don’t you ignore him tonight?

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.280
Be yourself.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.600
Just care about yourself.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.240
Let him be the one to adjust to you.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520
Come with me.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.640
Don’t worry about anything.
Forget everything.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.320
Because this is your life, May.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.000
(Pat)

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.640
Nop, you don't need to worry
about me when it comes to money.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.280
I found someone to help me.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920
This one,

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440
I won't let slip.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.880
- Hello, Pat.
- Hello.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.080
My girlfriend has been very busy,

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.440
so I asked you to help out.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.120
Have you seen her?

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.520
Not yet.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760
Okay.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200
Thank you.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.280
- Go ahead.
- Excuse me.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960
May.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.760
Where were you all night? You didn’t
answer my calls. What happened?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200
I...

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.840
I spent the night
at a subordinate's place.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.560
I left my phone at the office.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.160
May.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.360
I'm really sorry
for making you uncomfortable.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.920
I promise I will do better.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.800
Pat.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.200
Can we postpone

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.320
our wedding?

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.680
Don’t stay with someone just because
they're good to you.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.560
What are you doing here?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.480
I’m applying for a job
at your company.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.200
It’s nice to have Pat help out.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.280
I'm glad we're partners.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.800
Likewise.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.080
Just like this.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.000
Apply the cream here.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.560
It hurts.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.680
Just like that.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.240
How did you get the name Sexy May?

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560
Just May.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840
Yes.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.760
I need some soda.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920
Don't go far.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.280
Stay right here.
