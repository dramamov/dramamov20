(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:12.885
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:18.085
What are you doing over there?

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.685
The view here is
absolutely incredible.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.525
Having some coffee with this view...

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:26.395
would be just perfect.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.235
Da Hee, you want to have coffee
with me at a time like this?

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:34.165
Why?

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.735
Don't you have any questions for me?

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:38.335
I just don't get it.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:39.875
Why on earth would Da Hee do that?

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.375
You know Assistant Manager Kwak
from the PR Team?

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:45.845
A friend of his used to work
at the same company as Da Hee.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.015
She also got caught
bashing people online back then.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.055
It caused a huge uproar.

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:51.885
I had no idea.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.255
I was saying no one's as tight-lipped
as our Da Hee,

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:56.455
and I told her all my secrets.

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:58.555
You think you're the only one,
Seung Jae?

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:00.925
Mr. Ko.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:08.735
Why did she use "Hoppang" for an ID?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.835
Not sliced, garlic, or pizza bread.
Why hoppang, of all things?

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.475
Is that what you're curious about?

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:15.445
You see, with hoppang,
a steamed bun,

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:18.915
you can't know its true flavor
with just one bite.

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:22.855
Because the red bean filling
is hidden deep inside.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:24.955
I'm the same way.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.755
If I smile and act all friendly
on the outside,

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.365
people just assume
that's all there is to me.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:34.225
Like a bunch of fools.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.765
Are you calling those
who trusted you a fool right now?

00:01:39.705 --> 00:01:41.505
That's just malicious.

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:42.805
"Malicious?"

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:47.905
Then, since it's come to this,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.215
how about I get truly malicious...

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.615
and tell you one more lie?

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:54.545
What?

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.915
I mean,

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:01.255
it's possible I had my own sob story
about why I had no other choice.

00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:05.865
For example, I'm a psychopath
who can't read people.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.425
Shut it.

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:08.995
Or...

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:12.035
an alien who's here
to throw the world into chaos?

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:14.905
- Or if not that...
- Still talking, are we?

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.635
Or that I was abandoned
by my parents.

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:21.845
What?

00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:27.345
- Does "sorry" fix everything?
- An abandoned kid.

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:28.415
What will a child like that
amount to?

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:32.155
Who'd want a kid who wasn't sweet
and never smiled?

00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:35.525
I was adopted
and sent back several times.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:39.395
As I kept returning
to the orphanage,

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:41.465
I slowly started
to realize something.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.505
Oh, maybe...

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:50.505
the real me just wasn't good enough.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.305
Who wears those these days?

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:56.615
I hoped things would be different
when I grew up, but...

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:59.115
- Seriously.
- I know, right?

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.315
Excuse me, I think that's my seat.

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:10.295
But it was exactly the same.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.025
An office isn't
just a place for work.

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.265
You have to know how to get along
with people.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.305
Especially a pretty girl like you.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.035
Why are you like this?

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.435
That doubt I'd had
since I was a child...

00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:24.675
- You got that, right?
- was confirmed...

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:26.205
when I started work.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:29.075
- "So it's true."
- Yes.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.945
"I shouldn't live as my true self."

00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:34.145
From then on,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:37.615
I lived my life as a Jung Da Hee
people would like.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:41.785
Acting nice, acting sweet,
and always smiling.

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:43.825
- But at some point,
- Da Hee.

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:46.225
- it started to feel so unfair.
- About Mr. Lee...

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:48.935
He told people you two were a thing.

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:52.505
What? That's not true at all.

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:55.435
And you know Ji Min from
the Management Support Division?

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:57.235
Isn't she the worst?

00:03:57.235 --> 00:03:59.505
- Did you see what she was wearing?
- I lived my life wearing a mask...

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.175
- She is so tactless.
- and hid who I was.

00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:05.115
So when I see people living freely,
showing their true colors,

00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:07.615
it's nauseating,
and it makes me angry.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.395
So that's how I coped,
by letting off steam in my own way.

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:22.395
(What's wrong with that person
from the AE Team?)

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.765
It didn't actually
solve anything, though.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:36.345
Besides, secrets don't stay secret
for long anyway.

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.985
When my cover was blown,
I'd just move to a new company,

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:40.115
over and over.

00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:43.315
I repeated that same, tedious act.

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:48.385
Then one day, miraculously,
I met someone.

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:51.755
Someone just like me.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.265
She was sitting
in a transparent chair,

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:56.735
and I was wearing
a transparent mask.

00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:01.035
The way she tried so desperately
to fit in...

00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:02.975
was so much like me.

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:06.775
I couldn't get her out of my head.

00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:07.805
Da Hae.

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:09.975
But she just wouldn't
give me an opening.

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:11.715
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:15.885
I'd purposely get her Americanos,
knowing well she hated them.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:17.355
Wait a minute.

00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:18.615
You did that on purpose?

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:21.785
You knew I didn't like it,
and you did that on purpose?

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:22.995
Why?

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:27.665
So I'd have an excuse to apologize
and treat you to a meal.

00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:30.865
Gosh, you're really messed up,
aren't you?

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:34.705
You should have just stayed
Ms. Round, a roly-poly, then.

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:36.235
What?

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.475
Just like what a roly-poly is
meant to do,

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:42.075
you should've rolled around
and gotten stuck in a corner.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.815
Why did you
suddenly have to take flight?

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.215
When you do that,

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:50.085
it makes me want to lash out.

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:58.195
I feel like saying,
"You're no better than I am."

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:01.165
"Stop trying so hard
and just fall apart with me."

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.935
I just get this urge to rattle you.

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:06.205
Fall apart with you? How?

00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:09.605
What was I supposed to do?
Post nasty comments with you online?

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:13.705
That would've been nice,

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:17.415
but do you think people
would've let you get away with it?

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:22.615
All those people who genuinely care
about you and love you.

00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:25.515
Do you think they'd have stood by
and watched you fall apart?

00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:31.755
Okay, I get it.

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:37.535
- I get it, okay? So come down...
- No.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.005
If I go down now,

00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:42.835
I'll have to smile...

00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:45.205
and say it was all
a misunderstanding...

00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:47.575
and lie all over again.

00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:51.075
I don't want to do that anymore.

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:53.745
And I have no reason to.

00:06:58.115 --> 00:06:59.255
So, this is it.

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:05.255
This is it?

00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:06.595
This is it?

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:07.965
- Are you sure?
- What are you doing?

00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:09.135
Let go of me!

00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:11.935
Do you really need me to give you
a reason not to die?

00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:14.835
If you die on a Friday like today,

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.305
Darn it! Let go of me!

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:18.035
people will go to your weekend wake!

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:19.375
What did you just say?

00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:21.075
A weekend funeral
for your coworkers...

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:22.075
when they have to rest?

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:23.145
Are you out of your mind?

00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:27.545
I'd have to get my black clothes
dry-cleaned, just for you!

00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:30.215
- That hurts!
- Exactly!

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:35.385
So don't die and live.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.455
Live and fight through it!

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:39.425
You never know.

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:41.395
Things can change.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:44.265
You might even find the courage
to change things.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.235
A moment like that
could come for you too!

(Kang Eun Sang)

00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:08.585
By the way, Ji Hye,
did you check the delivery?

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.025
Yes, I checked it first thing
when I got in.

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:13.465
But I heard some items were missing.

00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:14.765
What?

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.365
About that... Just a moment.

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.965
If they report missing items,

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:22.035
call the logistics center
right away.

00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:25.435
- Here's the number.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:29.875
Ji Hye, what did you do
before working here?

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:35.285
I worked part-time
while I was job hunting.

00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:37.315
Gosh, that must have been tough.

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:39.685
Juggling work and job hunting.

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:43.525
Let's both give it our all.

00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:48.265
The handover period is short,
so I feel a little rushed myself.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.865
Yes, I'll do my absolute best.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:05.945
Why? Going to China
to get up to something again?

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:09.005
That's not it.
I have my own personal reasons...

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.075
Exactly!

00:10:10.915 --> 00:10:12.815
We're busy right now,
so put in your request another time.

00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:16.315
Yes, I understand.

00:10:24.695 --> 00:10:26.695
So Ji Song didn't get
her time off, then?

00:10:27.425 --> 00:10:31.735
Yes, she wanted to go to China
to learn to make tanghulu herself.

00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:35.735
Since she couldn't go, she's decided
to practice on her own today.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:38.835
Wait, but why on earth
is she practicing at the office?

00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:40.005
Oh, my.

00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:43.475
She said she burned a pot at home,
and you almost killed her.

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:46.685
Gosh, she completely scraped up
the bottom of the pot.

00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:48.285
Goodness.

00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:50.655
She's best buds with
the maintenance guy, you know.

00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:52.455
He said it was fine
if she cleaned up afterward.

00:10:52.555 --> 00:10:56.055
Gosh, she's got a long way to go.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.665
Anyway, where are we going
right now?

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:01.825
We're not going far.

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:04.195
We're going to a karaoke bar.

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:06.105
- Karaoke?
- Yes.

00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:15.775
Oh, what a beautiful day

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:19.985
Even the sun and the moon
are on my side

00:11:20.185 --> 00:11:22.785
Shining just for me

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.355
Oh, come...

00:11:26.825 --> 00:11:28.055
Hey, what's wrong?

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:31.395
Hey, we've only sung Dr. Ham's songs
for two hours.

00:11:31.395 --> 00:11:32.925
Isn't that enough?

00:11:33.065 --> 00:11:35.795
We got a perfect score 12 times!

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:36.935
Is that still not enough for you?

00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:39.605
It's not enough.

00:11:40.765 --> 00:11:42.035
It's not enough.

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:45.605
I need more of Dr. Ham.

00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:50.615
Eun Sang,
I'm having such a hard time.

00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:54.485
I miss Dr. Ham so much.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:12:00.625
How do I get through this?
What do I do?

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:03.425
Do you...

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:07.365
want me to tell you
how to get over it?

00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:08.825
Yes.

00:12:11.595 --> 00:12:13.035
You have to accept it.

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:16.505
That you can't get over it.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.475
What?

00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:25.245
Did you think you could just skip
the pain and hardship,

00:12:25.315 --> 00:12:27.115
like you're skipping an ad
on YouTube?

00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:32.055
You have to take it all in,
with every fiber of your being.

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:36.755
You must endure that agonizing pain
and see it through.

00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:40.925
And if you do that,
eventually, it might get a little...

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.935
Better?

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:47.105
I guess it gets better?

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:51.475
So does it get better or not?

00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:53.075
I don't know.

00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:56.345
Everyone says it'll get better.

00:12:56.545 --> 00:12:57.715
But I'm not so sure.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:02.915
I've never considered getting better
in the first place.

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:05.785
I've never even tried to,

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:08.585
so I'm still just...

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:15.125
living with one foot stuck
on the most painful day of my life.

00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:21.205
What's that supposed to mean?

00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:24.875
That's even more depressing!

00:13:25.775 --> 00:13:26.775
Hey.

00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:32.415
Fine. Go ahead and cry.

00:13:33.185 --> 00:13:34.945
You need something left inside
to cry.

00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:41.625
Let me know when you're done crying.

00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:45.095
I'll brief you on our plan
for tomorrow.

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:48.865
A plan for tomorrow?

00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:50.535
Why?

00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:52.635
What are we doing?

00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:55.335
Gosh, what is this piece of junk?

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.035
Stop calling it a piece of junk.

00:13:58.035 --> 00:13:59.875
This thing cost me a pretty penny.

00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:03.375
I think this is way worse
than the one we took to Namhae.

00:14:03.415 --> 00:14:06.245
Come on!
Hey, the GPS works just fine.

00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:10.455
Check this out.
The sunroof opens too!

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:14.355
Gosh, this is too much.
Close it already.

00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:16.195
Come on, lighten up.

00:14:16.395 --> 00:14:18.825
Isn't this a nice change of pace?

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:22.865
Did you see? Crypto's up again.

00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:26.505
Yes. They updated the network,
and the price has been skyrocketing.

00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:28.805
I'm going to sign the lease
for my shop right away.

00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:30.905
Hey, did you really do your research
on that shop?

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:31.975
I did, okay?

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:34.875
And I really want to quit my job.

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:37.845
I'm so sick of Mr. Song,
and Assistant Manager Oh...

00:14:37.915 --> 00:14:40.385
- What about Assistant Manager Oh?
- What?

00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:42.045
You know...

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:44.155
I've just got a lot on my mind.

00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:48.555
So I figured
this was a good chance...

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.155
to get it together
and focus on work only.

00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:52.255
Right, I believe in you, Ji Song.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:55.065
You're a grown-up now, after all.

00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:56.965
Come on. Of course.

00:14:57.035 --> 00:14:59.535
I'm a grown-up, so dinner's on me.

00:14:59.905 --> 00:15:01.905
So, where are we going anyway?

00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:03.935
I told you I'd show you
the real deal...

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:06.135
when it came to country food,
didn't I?

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:09.845
A thistle rice set
with a view of the countryside.

00:15:09.915 --> 00:15:11.875
- You have no idea how good it is.
- Thistle?

00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:15.645
I wonder if thistle can really
cure my sorrow.

00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:20.355
What? What's happening? Eun Sang!

00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:22.385
- It's raining! Close it!
- Close the sunroof!

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:23.625
- What's wrong? Close it!
- Okay.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:25.525
What? Why won't it work?

00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:27.725
- Hurry!
- Why won't it close?

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:29.795
What? Hey, it's not working!

00:15:30.495 --> 00:15:31.795
- Gosh!
- Eun Sang!

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:32.865
Eun Sang!

00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:35.135
Eun Sang!

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.775
What is going on with my hair?

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.575
- Help me see!
- Eun Sang, your hair!

00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:40.975
Get my hair off my face!

00:15:43.115 --> 00:15:44.145
What is all this?

00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:46.315
I can't see, Ji Song!

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.145
Where are we even going?

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.465
- Eun Sang.
- Eun Sang, get in, quick.

00:16:04.535 --> 00:16:06.305
- Goodness.
- How's the car?

00:16:07.865 --> 00:16:10.075
I guess I can't do long deliveries
in this car.

00:16:10.205 --> 00:16:11.535
- What do you mean? Deliveries?
- What?

00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:14.875
The truth is,
I bought this car to earn money.

00:16:15.305 --> 00:16:17.815
There's the errand center,
green juice delivery, or a taxi.

00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:19.615
You can do so much with a car.

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:22.515
I can't just sit around idly
after quitting my job.

00:16:23.155 --> 00:16:24.415
That figures.

00:16:24.685 --> 00:16:29.125
You earn all that money
just to make even more money.

00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:31.595
Good grief. What a mess.

00:16:34.265 --> 00:16:35.595
- What?
- Eun Sang,

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:37.665
a fire truck's coming.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.765
- What do I do? Should I back up?
- Yes.

00:16:48.545 --> 00:16:49.575
What?

00:16:50.215 --> 00:16:51.375
Oh, no, why aren't we moving?

00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:53.815
- Why aren't we moving?
- It's not working?

00:16:53.845 --> 00:16:55.585
- What are we going to do?
- We have a collision up ahead.

00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:56.855
Please move your vehicle.

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:59.825
Yes, I'm trying to. Just a moment.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.425
I'm having some trouble with it.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:04.555
Hurry up!

00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:08.065
Eun Sang!
Hey. Let's get out and push.

00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:10.195
- Yes, go push with her.
- Okay, Eun Sang.

00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:12.465
Just a second!

00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:14.705
- We're so sorry!
- Okay.

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:16.105
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.035
Push! Are you guys pushing?

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.575
Are you pushing?

00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:24.815
Eun Sang, I don't think
this is going to work!

00:17:25.175 --> 00:17:27.115
- What do you mean?
- What's wrong with this?

00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:30.685
What is it?

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:34.325
- Hurry up!
- Did a wheel fall off or something?

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:36.395
- We're so sorry!
- One, two, three!

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:43.495
Command vehicle en route.
Eight kids in the overturned bus.

00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:46.505
Eun Sang. I think children were
in an accident.

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:49.805
Mom.

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:52.175
A daycare shuttle bus
driving on a rainy road...

00:17:52.235 --> 00:17:55.745
has crashed into a guardrail
on a street in Seoul.

00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:58.375
Four people were injured
in the crash,

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:01.245
and a five-year-old girl has died.

00:18:01.615 --> 00:18:05.355
The child was rushed to the hospital
in cardiac arrest after the crash,

00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:07.685
but she tragically passed away.

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:17.765
- Just go.
- Excuse me?

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:20.135
Just strike my car and go.

00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:42.855
What are we going to do, Eun Sang?

00:18:45.855 --> 00:18:48.965
At 1 p.m. today in Gochon-eup,
Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province,

00:18:49.025 --> 00:18:51.835
a daycare bus that was
on its way to an event...

00:18:52.035 --> 00:18:54.065
tragically overturned.

00:18:54.335 --> 00:18:56.405
Following the report,
firefighters...

00:18:56.405 --> 00:18:59.535
were quickly dispatched to the scene
and began rescue operations.

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:02.075
Fortunately, all passengers
were rescued safely...

00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:04.045
and taken to a nearby hospital.

00:19:04.415 --> 00:19:06.985
Onboard the vehicle during the crash
were eight daycare children...

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:10.385
- Seems no one was seriously hurt.
- What a relief.

00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:12.055
I almost had a heart attack.

00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:14.155
The undercarriage is
totally wrecked.

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:15.925
The muffler's badly corroded too.

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.355
Nothing here is worth salvaging.

00:19:18.495 --> 00:19:20.395
If you keep driving it,
it will be trouble on the highway.

00:19:20.465 --> 00:19:22.265
So it's better to stop now...

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.495
than on the highway, right?

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.135
Let's junk it.

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:28.565
- Okay.
- What?

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:30.435
Are you serious?

00:19:30.505 --> 00:19:33.875
Wait.
Didn't you spend a fortune on this?

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:34.875
Are you sure about this?

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.615
Of course I am.

00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:40.585
Actually, it's better than okay.

00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:43.485
Hey, guys.

00:19:45.055 --> 00:19:47.525
I'm finally calling it quits.

00:19:47.725 --> 00:19:48.955
- What?
- What?

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.355
Just like that car,

00:19:51.425 --> 00:19:53.795
I think it's time for me
to stop too.

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.465
Just because I made money...

00:19:57.535 --> 00:20:00.965
doesn't mean life
will only be full of joy, right?

00:20:01.965 --> 00:20:05.275
There will still be times of sadness
and times of anger.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:10.715
But what's important
is what we choose to focus on...

00:20:10.775 --> 00:20:13.315
and the choices we make,
don't you think?

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.815
And rather than just keep going,

00:20:19.455 --> 00:20:21.555
I'm choosing to stop here.

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:26.765
I want to rest now.
I think I've earned it.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.565
What are you two going to do?

00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:35.635
Ms. Kim Ji Song.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:42.275
I told you not to take days off,
but I see you did it anyway.

00:20:43.515 --> 00:20:44.515
Yes.

00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:48.345
The Labor Standards Act guarantees
employees the right to annual leave.

00:20:50.615 --> 00:20:53.525
What, "employees?" "Rights?"

00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:55.185
Ms. Kim Ji Song,

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:56.625
what do you know?

00:20:56.695 --> 00:20:58.795
You think you're a legal expert?

00:20:58.955 --> 00:21:00.195
You think you know the law?

00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:02.325
Keep it up.

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:05.295
I may not know the law,
but the lawyer I'll hire will.

00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:06.465
What?

00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:12.405
I've avoided you all this time.
Not out of fear, but out of disgust.

00:21:12.475 --> 00:21:13.605
But after some thought,

00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:16.815
scary or disgusting,
I shouldn't be avoiding it anymore.

00:21:17.415 --> 00:21:18.515
If something is disgusting,

00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:20.785
I should just throw it in the trash.

00:21:23.855 --> 00:21:25.085
"Trash?"

00:21:26.015 --> 00:21:27.025
"Trash?"

00:21:28.285 --> 00:21:30.425
Are you calling me trash right now?

00:21:36.665 --> 00:21:37.995
(Letter of resignation)

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:41.965
Oh, my. That was so cool.

00:21:45.475 --> 00:21:46.475
Ms. Kim Ji Song.

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.005
Are you crazy?

00:21:48.005 --> 00:21:49.775
Me? Why do you ask?

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.745
You power-trip and deny me the leave
I'm entitled to, which is absurd.

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:54.615
You verbally abuse me with nonsense,

00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:56.485
and you're always
disgustingly touchy.

00:21:56.485 --> 00:21:58.755
Aren't you the crazy one, Mr. Song?

00:22:00.655 --> 00:22:01.725
Now that I'm quitting,

00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:04.295
I won't have to call you
Mr. Song anymore.

00:22:05.055 --> 00:22:06.225
Mister.

00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:11.235
"Mister?"

00:22:11.395 --> 00:22:14.135
"Mister?"
You've really lost it, haven't you?

00:22:14.205 --> 00:22:15.465
Mr. Song!

00:22:16.165 --> 00:22:18.305
- Sir, please don't...
- That hurts! Let me go!

00:22:19.475 --> 00:22:20.705
Hey, who do you think you are?

00:22:20.845 --> 00:22:22.405
Are you crazy?

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:24.915
I go easy on you people,
and this is what I get. Darn it.

00:22:27.685 --> 00:22:30.785
What was that?
Why are you interfering?

00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:32.985
Ji Song, are you really quitting?

00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:34.855
Was that your resignation letter
you threw at him?

00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:37.855
You defended me without knowing?

00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:41.825
I'm fine since I'm quitting,
but what about you, Mr. Oh?

00:22:41.825 --> 00:22:43.025
Don't worry about me.

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:45.695
And you deserved to be defended.

00:22:45.835 --> 00:22:47.635
Why shouldn't you get your days off?

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:50.935
Plus, at the end of last month,
you pulled all-nighters by yourself.

00:22:51.405 --> 00:22:54.505
And you were also the one who fixed
the accounting mistake yourself.

00:22:56.205 --> 00:22:59.245
I really hate the thought
of you quitting.

00:23:02.385 --> 00:23:03.385
But still, Ji Song,

00:23:03.985 --> 00:23:07.355
you have every right
to do whatever you want.

00:23:07.355 --> 00:23:08.455
Look down.

00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:12.325
What? Okay.

00:23:14.465 --> 00:23:17.735
I'm about to start a business
relying only on my gut feeling.

00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:21.005
So what am I supposed to do
if my gut keeps being so wrong?

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:24.935
What do you mean,
your gut was wrong?

00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:29.705
I didn't think I'd get butterflies!

00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:32.345
Never did I think...

00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:35.185
I'd get butterflies for you, Mr. Oh.

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:39.955
But you keep making my heart race,
and acting like this...

00:23:42.285 --> 00:23:43.525
What am I supposed to do?

00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:50.835
(Jung Da Hee)

00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:57.735
It's a shame
I have to leave so suddenly.

00:23:58.135 --> 00:23:59.805
You're just giving us the creeps.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.775
There was a bit
of an unfortunate incident,

00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:06.015
and I regret leaving without
clearing up the misunderstanding.

00:24:06.675 --> 00:24:10.415
But being able to work
with all of you...

00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:12.215
was a true pleasure.

00:24:16.085 --> 00:24:17.855
Well then, I'll be taking my leave.

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:35.875
Well, this is awkward.

00:24:37.145 --> 00:24:38.215
I thought I gave...

00:24:38.615 --> 00:24:41.845
a pretty moving speech back then.

00:24:42.545 --> 00:24:44.185
It's amazing
how little you've changed.

00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:47.085
I wonder...

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:50.295
- what you were expecting.
- Gosh.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.165
Here, just take this.

00:24:59.795 --> 00:25:01.235
About the snack subscription box...

00:25:01.465 --> 00:25:04.105
You're aware there's still room
for improvement, right?

00:25:05.475 --> 00:25:07.205
You're going to have to work
a lot harder.

00:25:13.515 --> 00:25:14.515
Darn it.

00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:24.655
I've compiled the handover materials
into this file for you.

00:25:24.925 --> 00:25:27.225
It has everything from A to Z,

00:25:27.465 --> 00:25:29.565
so just check here
if you get confused.

00:25:29.825 --> 00:25:31.265
Okay, thank you.

00:25:31.995 --> 00:25:33.295
(3rd floor meeting room,
12th floor hallway)

00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:37.405
If you time it right, you can get
about ten minutes alone.

00:25:37.775 --> 00:25:40.805
No, wait. You can rest
for about 20 minutes there.

00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:43.205
When you're working hard
and feel worn out,

00:25:43.405 --> 00:25:45.645
you should go to one of these places
and take a break.

00:25:46.075 --> 00:25:48.915
I never rested when I was tired,

00:25:48.915 --> 00:25:50.885
and I never cried when I was sad,

00:25:51.715 --> 00:25:54.885
so it felt like
something inside me just broke.

00:25:56.225 --> 00:25:58.295
Don't you be like that, Ji Hye.
All right?

00:25:58.525 --> 00:26:01.895
Take time to cry and rest.
Pace yourself.

00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:03.395
That's how you last in the long run.

00:26:04.465 --> 00:26:05.465
Okay.

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:07.665
Eun Sang.

00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:14.105
Come on, why are you all crying...

00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:15.675
like it's the end of the world?

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:19.415
Come on, everyone. Chin up.

00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:22.915
- Have grit! You must...
- Eun Sang...

00:26:24.315 --> 00:26:26.385
Don't just live by being tough
all the time.

00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:29.025
If you ever feel like
having a stiff drink,

00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:31.695
call me anytime. Got it?

00:26:32.195 --> 00:26:34.825
No, really. Please do call.

00:26:36.025 --> 00:26:37.035
Eun Sang.

00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:40.635
Okay.

00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:44.935
- What?
- About this promotion,

00:26:45.475 --> 00:26:47.705
they backed HR's Team Leader Choi.

00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:50.315
No, but they promised I was next.

00:26:50.315 --> 00:26:52.875
Mr. Choi has a widowed mother.

00:26:52.875 --> 00:26:54.315
He's also got four kids.

00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:57.055
And he also went to the same school
as Director Kim.

00:26:59.415 --> 00:27:00.725
As for you, Mr. Ko,

00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:04.695
let's aim for the next one.
All right?

00:27:11.565 --> 00:27:14.165
This is driving me crazy.

00:27:14.765 --> 00:27:16.265
What am I going to tell her?

00:27:20.235 --> 00:27:22.305
(Honey, I'm just joking,)

00:27:22.305 --> 00:27:24.645
(but what if I quit my job
and opened a cafe?)

00:27:30.145 --> 00:27:31.285
Should I get into crypto
or something?

00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:35.955
Oh, gosh.

00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:38.755
I'm so baffled and speechless!

00:27:39.025 --> 00:27:41.025
What kind of psycho brat
throws a resignation letter...

00:27:41.025 --> 00:27:42.295
in her superior's face?

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:45.295
And when did I ever even touch her?

00:27:45.365 --> 00:27:47.865
If her superior treats her nicely,

00:27:47.865 --> 00:27:49.435
she should know how to be grateful.

00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:51.005
How dare she be arrogant
for someone in her position!

00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:52.975
Just because
she made some money off crypto,

00:27:52.975 --> 00:27:54.445
she thinks she's hot stuff.

00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:57.515
Kids these days.
They have no darn manners.

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:01.815
But what's with you,
just sitting there like that?

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:05.855
Now that Eun Sang is gone,

00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:09.585
my future looks bleak and scary.

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.765
But you didn't actually
touch her, did you?

00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:18.565
I barely grazed her.

00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:19.565
Hey!

00:28:20.035 --> 00:28:23.065
- Goodness!
- You are a real jerk, aren't you?

00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:25.835
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:27.305
I couldn't stand
hearing about crypto...

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:28.475
and about
pursuing self-actualization...

00:28:28.475 --> 00:28:30.875
while they messed around at work.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:31.915
But you're a jerk.

00:28:31.945 --> 00:28:33.075
I'd do the same thing
in her shoes...

00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:35.645
with this bad company
and an even more terrible superior.

00:28:35.845 --> 00:28:38.455
If even I feel this way,
can you imagine how they feel?

00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:41.285
- No wonder they want to leave.
- Hey!

00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:42.355
What? You got a problem?

00:28:42.985 --> 00:28:44.925
Why should I understand
their feelings...

00:28:44.925 --> 00:28:46.755
because of a jerk like you?

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:51.135
Why can't I be the grumpy old boss
in peace because of you?

00:28:51.195 --> 00:28:52.195
Darn it!

00:28:52.495 --> 00:28:53.635
Why you little...

00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:57.805
Hey, Ko Dae Young.
Hey, where are you...

00:28:58.305 --> 00:29:01.375
Hey, what's his problem?

00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:04.415
- Does he not want to work here?
- I guess so?

00:29:04.545 --> 00:29:06.515
- Unbelievable.
- I wonder why.

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:09.785
I like working here, though.

00:29:12.015 --> 00:29:13.955
Only if it weren't for
old-school guys like you.

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:17.555
Hey!

00:29:18.325 --> 00:29:19.395
Hey!

00:29:26.295 --> 00:29:29.005
Do I really have to be here
this late on the day I quit?

00:29:29.365 --> 00:29:30.675
I'm so sick of this.

00:29:31.405 --> 00:29:33.575
What can we do? We had to work late.

00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:35.705
All right!

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:38.775
Let's all say a few words
before the big moment.

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.245
Well, about that...

00:29:42.845 --> 00:29:44.085
Can a few words even cover it?

00:29:45.255 --> 00:29:47.015
We have it too!

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.625
Something to turn this all around.

00:29:49.525 --> 00:29:50.855
Our ace in the hole!

00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:52.655
I can't bear to watch...

00:29:53.195 --> 00:29:54.365
you two collapse.

00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:55.865
I won't let that happen to you two!

00:29:55.925 --> 00:29:57.535
- Oh, my.
- Let's go! To the moon!

00:29:57.665 --> 00:29:59.765
- To the moon!
- Let's go! To the moon!

00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:01.565
Get ready. Let's do this.

00:30:03.565 --> 00:30:04.935
(Your buy order has been
successfully placed.)

00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:10.875
I'm going to be with you guys
until the very end.

00:30:11.315 --> 00:30:13.645
Then let's go all the way.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:16.185
- Let's keep going!
- Let's keep going!

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:19.615
But if I had to leave
one last thought,

00:30:20.055 --> 00:30:21.055
I...

00:30:21.425 --> 00:30:23.155
I'm free!

00:30:24.195 --> 00:30:25.325
Let's do it.

00:30:25.325 --> 00:30:27.025
(Enderion, Confirm Sell?)

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.095
(Your sell order has been
successfully placed.)

00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:33.865
Good job, Jung Da Hae.

00:30:36.865 --> 00:30:39.235
(Enderion, Confirm Sell?)

00:30:39.235 --> 00:30:40.235
(Your sell order has been
successfully placed.)

00:30:42.275 --> 00:30:44.115
Kang Eun Sang,
you've worked hard too!

00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:49.815
(Enderion, Confirm Sell?)

00:30:49.885 --> 00:30:50.885
(Your sell order has been
successfully placed.)

00:30:52.255 --> 00:30:54.485
Kim Ji Song, you did great too!

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:00.995
And at this very moment...

00:31:01.525 --> 00:31:02.565
Ta-da!

00:31:02.665 --> 00:31:06.165
- Student loans paid off!
- Gosh, no more debt!

00:31:06.335 --> 00:31:07.365
Congratulations!

00:31:07.935 --> 00:31:11.405
No, we're the ones
who should be thanking you.

00:31:11.735 --> 00:31:12.805
We owe it all to you.

00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:14.205
What?

00:31:14.775 --> 00:31:16.905
For giving me a life...

00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:19.815
I never could have imagined
or even dared to dream of.

00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:23.885
And for
pulling me into this grand story.

00:31:24.715 --> 00:31:25.915
Thank you for everything, Eun Sang.

00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:29.985
Me too.

00:31:31.755 --> 00:31:35.495
I'm incredibly grateful, Eun Sang!
No, scratch that. I love you.

00:31:35.895 --> 00:31:38.165
Me too! I love you, Kang Eun Sang!

00:31:38.235 --> 00:31:40.435
You guys. This is so cheesy. Stop.

00:31:40.495 --> 00:31:42.365
Hey. Get off me.

00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:46.375
Goodness.

00:31:47.345 --> 00:31:49.775
- What's that?
- Looks like there's a festival.

00:31:50.005 --> 00:31:51.945
There's that university
nearby, right?

00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:54.415
It's perfect.

00:31:56.085 --> 00:31:57.485
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:31:58.215 --> 00:31:59.215
Everyone!

00:31:59.515 --> 00:32:01.585
It's a beautiful night!

00:32:38.925 --> 00:32:40.225
Right, I quit my job.

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:44.935
I can sleep in.

00:33:38.155 --> 00:33:39.455
In the void,

00:33:39.455 --> 00:33:41.825
where the numbers and goals
that once filled her life...

00:33:41.825 --> 00:33:43.255
used to be,

00:33:49.025 --> 00:33:50.965
a moment of mourning
found its way in.

00:34:07.615 --> 00:34:11.815
It was like she was finally learning
how to truly cry.

00:34:12.455 --> 00:34:13.755
She cried endlessly.

00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:16.025
She cried her heart out.

00:34:36.905 --> 00:34:37.945
Da Hae!

00:34:38.575 --> 00:34:39.575
Da Hae?

00:34:40.475 --> 00:34:41.485
Hey.

00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:42.915
Where's Eun Sang?

00:34:43.515 --> 00:34:44.555
She left.

00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:45.755
What?

00:34:46.215 --> 00:34:47.215
(I'll be back after I cry.)

00:34:47.215 --> 00:34:49.285
Just how much
does she plan on crying?

00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:52.525
So, you have no idea where she went?

00:34:52.955 --> 00:34:53.955
No.

00:34:55.325 --> 00:34:56.325
But...

00:34:57.535 --> 00:34:58.895
let's just give her some space.

00:34:59.495 --> 00:35:00.665
Let her cry her heart out.

00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:06.205
What about you?
What happened with that deposit?

00:35:06.405 --> 00:35:07.445
You can't get it back?

00:35:08.275 --> 00:35:09.275
Well...

00:35:10.105 --> 00:35:11.715
I'll just have to chalk it up
as an expensive life lesson.

00:35:12.715 --> 00:35:14.285
Ji Song had been scammed.

00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:18.985
The place Ji Song put a deposit on
was a fraudulent listing.

00:35:20.615 --> 00:35:22.385
Even though it must have been
a devastating blow,

00:35:22.385 --> 00:35:24.525
- I can't believe she just left.
- Ji Song no longer lets...

00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:27.895
one setback keep her down for long.

00:35:28.595 --> 00:35:29.595
Look at this.

00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:33.365
Are you really okay?

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:35.335
I have to just shake it off.

00:35:36.465 --> 00:35:37.705
Plus, I've already got my eye
on a new place.

00:35:39.335 --> 00:35:42.875
Gosh, our Ji Song is
all grown up now.

00:35:43.605 --> 00:35:44.645
Are you going right now?

00:35:45.175 --> 00:35:46.215
What are you going to do there?

00:35:48.785 --> 00:35:51.015
And then there was me.

00:36:05.395 --> 00:36:06.635
This is always a good sight.

00:36:08.205 --> 00:36:10.665
Well, it would've been nicer
with him.

00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:20.845
Will you...

00:36:21.985 --> 00:36:22.985
marry me?

00:36:32.555 --> 00:36:33.595
I miss you.

00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:39.035
I miss you.

00:36:55.985 --> 00:36:58.285
July 20, 1969.

00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:02.885
The historic moment when Apollo 11
made the 1st manned moon landing.

00:37:03.425 --> 00:37:08.025
But maybe the real story
is what happened after the landing.

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:10.895
(1 year later)

00:37:11.065 --> 00:37:14.165
After all, just getting to the moon
wasn't the end of the journey.

00:37:14.905 --> 00:37:16.835
What path you should take next,

00:37:16.905 --> 00:37:19.105
and what direction
you're currently facing.

00:37:19.105 --> 00:37:20.135
That's what's more important.

00:37:20.535 --> 00:37:23.775
But that's something that's hard
to figure out on your own.

00:37:24.005 --> 00:37:27.075
After all, Apollo 11 was in
constant communication with Earth,

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:29.115
which was how it was able to
land safely on the moon,

00:37:29.185 --> 00:37:32.185
and how the world could see
that moment as it happened.

00:37:32.515 --> 00:37:36.355
Isn't communication about learning
where you're both headed...

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:40.095
and gradually aligning your paths
so you can walk forward together?

00:37:40.965 --> 00:37:43.695
Here are some more examples...

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:45.035
of why workplace
communication matters.

00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:48.605
(Diamond Tanghulu)

00:37:48.765 --> 00:37:51.105
(Diamond Tanghulu:
Sweetness Crystallized)

00:37:58.475 --> 00:38:00.045
(Tangerine, 2 dollars
Whole Jeju tangerine, 4.5 dollars)

00:38:06.915 --> 00:38:07.925
(Kang Eun Sang:
Customers in, sales out)

00:38:08.025 --> 00:38:10.255
(Jung Da Hae: I guarantee
this place is good.)

00:38:13.925 --> 00:38:17.295
Ms. Kim,
your mango tanghulu is ready.

00:38:17.365 --> 00:38:18.465
Thank you.

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:23.935
Seriously, boss, how did you know
the shop would do so well?

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.175
You just have good instincts?

00:38:25.305 --> 00:38:27.805
I've had my moments.

00:38:28.775 --> 00:38:33.475
Back then, trusting my instincts
was all I really had going for me.

00:38:33.675 --> 00:38:35.445
I guess that's why
I was so obsessed with it.

00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:39.355
I guess you could say it felt like
my greatest weapon back then.

00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:43.385
- And not anymore?
- Gosh, of course not.

00:38:43.825 --> 00:38:45.755
Now, I'm my own greatest weapon.

00:38:47.295 --> 00:38:48.295
Just you wait.

00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:51.465
Tanghulu will be even bigger soon.

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:52.635
And you know why?

00:38:52.695 --> 00:38:54.135
Because I'm going to make it happen.

00:38:55.005 --> 00:38:56.365
I sure hope so.

00:38:56.765 --> 00:39:00.875
The landlord here is giving you
a great deal on the rent.

00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:05.815
- This is how you'll get rich.
- Stop.

00:39:06.045 --> 00:39:07.045
I appreciate it.

00:39:07.715 --> 00:39:08.715
Mom, here.

00:39:09.115 --> 00:39:11.415
I got you something for the season.

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:12.615
This color looks great on you.

00:39:12.915 --> 00:39:14.425
You shouldn't have.

00:39:14.655 --> 00:39:16.425
Thank you. I'll wear it often.

00:39:16.725 --> 00:39:20.325
Right. And also,
Ji Song packed these just for you.

00:39:20.555 --> 00:39:22.065
It's strawberry and grape tanghulu.

00:39:22.265 --> 00:39:24.765
But she runs a business.
Is it okay to give freebies?

00:39:24.765 --> 00:39:26.635
Thank her for me. I'll enjoy them.

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.665
Right. And this is for you, Dad.

00:39:31.575 --> 00:39:32.735
For me? What is it?

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.745
I look good in any color,

00:39:37.005 --> 00:39:39.275
and I like tomato just as much
as strawberry or grape.

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:41.745
It's your phone bill.

00:39:43.545 --> 00:39:44.555
I see.

00:39:45.985 --> 00:39:47.725
Of course. I should pay it.

00:39:50.925 --> 00:39:52.825
Excuse me for a second.

00:40:03.565 --> 00:40:05.235
Don't be so hard on him.

00:40:05.905 --> 00:40:08.075
Like it or not, we live together.

00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:09.375
When he's hunched over and moping,

00:40:09.445 --> 00:40:11.245
do you have any idea
how much that gets on my nerves?

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:12.545
What did I do?

00:40:13.575 --> 00:40:16.385
Still, it's not like
your father is a complete failure.

00:40:17.885 --> 00:40:19.455
Name one thing he's done right.

00:40:20.555 --> 00:40:21.885
For one thing, your father...

00:40:24.325 --> 00:40:25.725
He has never done drugs.

00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:27.355
And he's never murdered anyone.

00:40:28.195 --> 00:40:30.365
Gosh, just stop.

00:40:31.335 --> 00:40:32.735
Lately,

00:40:33.235 --> 00:40:35.265
it looks like
he's been studying stocks.

00:40:35.665 --> 00:40:37.735
Another one of his useless schemes.

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:41.075
Tell him to get a real job
if he wants to support himself.

00:40:41.175 --> 00:40:42.975
And you? Is making a living
the only reason you work?

00:40:45.475 --> 00:40:46.675
Mom, whose side are you on?

00:40:46.675 --> 00:40:48.085
I'm not taking sides.

00:40:49.145 --> 00:40:51.185
We're all
in the same miserable boat.

00:41:00.255 --> 00:41:01.325
See you.

00:41:02.595 --> 00:41:03.595
What?

00:41:03.995 --> 00:41:04.995
Are you leaving already?

00:41:05.965 --> 00:41:07.495
Look, I bought ice cream.

00:41:07.805 --> 00:41:09.405
- What am I, a kid?
- Goodness.

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:13.105
Come on, I even got yours in a cone.

00:41:13.205 --> 00:41:15.605
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

00:41:16.445 --> 00:41:18.515
He doesn't commit murder.
He doesn't do drugs.

00:41:19.045 --> 00:41:21.215
And he buys his daughter's ice cream
in a cone.

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:22.745
What are you talking about?

00:41:23.245 --> 00:41:25.885
You make it impossible
not to be a good daughter.

00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:33.625
What's this?

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:35.925
Investment money.

00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:37.595
What?

00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:40.095
Didn't you say there was something
you wanted to do?

00:41:42.765 --> 00:41:44.165
From what I can tell,

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:48.245
you're just not the type of person
to ever find a four-leaf clover.

00:41:48.605 --> 00:41:50.305
You were born with terrible luck.

00:41:52.115 --> 00:41:56.515
Yet, you have all these ambitions,
wanting to do this and that.

00:41:58.485 --> 00:42:00.215
But who can blame you for that?

00:42:00.815 --> 00:42:02.085
I was the same way.

00:42:06.295 --> 00:42:09.695
So, just this once,
trust me and take a leap of faith.

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:13.235
Just this one time,

00:42:14.805 --> 00:42:16.635
I'll be your good luck.

00:42:19.075 --> 00:42:20.175
Da Hae.

00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:25.445
But don't get in over your head.
Only go as far as you can manage.

00:42:25.545 --> 00:42:26.715
Please.

00:42:27.145 --> 00:42:29.985
Hey, this time's different.
I really did my homework.

00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:34.315
I looked through the reports
and followed the earnings.

00:42:34.855 --> 00:42:37.725
I even watched the CEO interviews.

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:39.655
What's the company's name?

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:41.565
You know.

00:42:41.925 --> 00:42:45.365
Mask? Is it Elon Musk?

00:42:45.365 --> 00:42:47.465
The one that guy runs.

00:42:48.635 --> 00:42:53.305
Mark my words,
the age of electric cars is coming.

00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:55.345
I'm telling you, this is the one.

00:42:55.775 --> 00:42:58.445
Please. Like I'd believe you.

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:01.075
You can laugh all you want,
but this is the real deal.

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:03.215
You always say, "This is it."

00:43:03.215 --> 00:43:06.285
No, I thought it was real back then,
but I really studied this one.

00:43:06.355 --> 00:43:08.085
- This one...
- You said you studied then too.

00:43:08.155 --> 00:43:10.125
Look, when it rains,
the ground gets wet.

00:43:10.125 --> 00:43:11.225
- So?
- It's just like that.

00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:13.755
- It's a sure thing.
- This is hopeless. Give it back!

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:14.825
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

00:43:16.065 --> 00:43:20.235
That was a request from Lee Ju Ah
from Gwanak-gu.

00:43:20.295 --> 00:43:22.335
We just enjoyed the song
by Ham Ji Woo.

00:43:23.135 --> 00:43:25.205
Now, some of you
might already know this,

00:43:25.275 --> 00:43:28.445
but he's an artist active
in the English-speaking world.

00:43:29.175 --> 00:43:31.815
He's been getting quite popular
here in Korea lately too.

00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:35.085
He did an interview a while back.

00:43:35.285 --> 00:43:36.685
It was pretty interesting.

00:43:37.045 --> 00:43:40.955
"I don't want to make music
to comfort people."

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:44.695
"I just hope people's lives
aren't so difficult..."

00:43:44.695 --> 00:43:47.595
"or lonely that they'd need
to be comforted."

00:43:48.265 --> 00:43:50.625
"For people's best,
happiest moments,"

00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:53.265
"I just want to make music
that's like a celebration."

00:43:54.905 --> 00:43:56.865
"You think my songs are too mellow?"

00:43:57.365 --> 00:44:00.175
"You don't think I won't make much
in royalties?"

00:44:00.175 --> 00:44:01.475
"Don't worry about it."

00:44:01.475 --> 00:44:04.975
"When I had a corporate job,
I saved up plenty of bonus money,"

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.175
"so it's okay."

00:44:06.715 --> 00:44:09.085
"So, everyone, be happy."

00:44:09.545 --> 00:44:12.315
"Make sure to be happy."

00:44:12.915 --> 00:44:14.455
He's a fun guy, isn't he?

00:44:14.855 --> 00:44:17.425
I hear he'll have
a show in Korea soon.

00:44:17.995 --> 00:44:19.425
I should probably go check it out.

00:44:22.695 --> 00:44:23.695
(Jung Da Hee)

00:44:23.825 --> 00:44:25.935
Looks like your ex has a concert
coming up.

00:44:28.735 --> 00:44:29.735
(Mobile ticket)

00:44:32.905 --> 00:44:35.205
(Ham Ji Woo, "With You")

00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:38.075
My ex?

00:44:39.245 --> 00:44:40.675
I said, tuna.

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.515
Sashimi? Yes, tuna.

00:44:43.915 --> 00:44:47.155
So, in our dressing room,
you must have it set up.

00:44:47.215 --> 00:44:49.055
That's a requirement to book us.

00:44:49.255 --> 00:44:51.225
Yes, but sorry about this time.

00:44:51.285 --> 00:44:53.525
Right now, we are already in Korea.

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:57.095
Next time you invite us again,

00:44:57.595 --> 00:44:59.295
we would be very thankful.

00:44:59.995 --> 00:45:03.605
So, for the detailed schedule,
we can touch base nearer the date.

00:45:03.605 --> 00:45:05.605
And the performance fee...

00:45:07.275 --> 00:45:09.045
Please make sure the event fee is...

00:45:09.045 --> 00:45:10.975
clearly stated
in the contract in advance.

00:45:10.975 --> 00:45:13.615
I would appreciate it
if the payment could be completed...

00:45:13.615 --> 00:45:15.115
within one week of the performance.

00:45:15.185 --> 00:45:17.415
Any additional documents
will be sent through the label.

00:45:17.745 --> 00:45:18.855
Okay, bye.

00:45:23.225 --> 00:45:24.925
How are you suddenly so fluent...

00:45:24.925 --> 00:45:26.295
when talking about
the performance fee?

00:45:26.355 --> 00:45:27.355
Shut it.

00:45:27.425 --> 00:45:29.895
Seriously, for a 200-seat theater,

00:45:29.965 --> 00:45:32.595
you think it's wise to give up a gig
in Manchester?

00:45:32.665 --> 00:45:35.605
Why does the venue's size matter?
It's the meaning that counts.

00:45:35.665 --> 00:45:37.605
No, I mean, the "meaning..."

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:40.475
Let me explain this to you again.

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:42.505
If you two haven't talked in a year,

00:45:42.605 --> 00:45:43.675
that means you broke up.

00:45:43.675 --> 00:45:46.475
We, as a society,
have agreed to call that a breakup.

00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:47.875
Oh, come on.

00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:50.815
I just came to Korea
to perform for a good cause.

00:45:50.885 --> 00:45:52.015
I'll get fans here...

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:54.515
and donate the profit.
Isn't that great?

00:45:54.615 --> 00:45:56.185
You look like you need donations.

00:45:56.185 --> 00:45:58.425
How can you wear flip-flops
all year?

00:45:58.495 --> 00:46:00.325
I'm telling you, my feet hurt.

00:46:00.325 --> 00:46:01.795
I can't wear dress shoes.

00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:04.665
Right. I'm sure they hurt.

00:46:05.435 --> 00:46:08.305
You're probably still hurting. Yes.

00:46:10.235 --> 00:46:12.205
Please, just leave it.
I can do it myself.

00:46:12.275 --> 00:46:15.975
Oh, no, it's okay.
This is too heavy for you, Ji Song.

00:46:16.145 --> 00:46:17.245
I can handle it.

00:46:17.745 --> 00:46:20.575
You must be so busy with work,
but you always help me like this.

00:46:20.915 --> 00:46:23.645
It's good exercise.

00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:25.185
And I kind of enjoy it.

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:28.785
Sorry, we're closed...

00:46:31.325 --> 00:46:32.325
Ji Song.

00:46:33.055 --> 00:46:34.055
Wei Lin?

00:46:42.305 --> 00:46:43.665
What are you doing here?

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:47.435
I came to see you, Ji Song,
and to check out your shop.

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:48.645
Kind of like
killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

00:46:48.905 --> 00:46:50.505
"Killing 2 birds with 1 stone?"

00:46:51.105 --> 00:46:52.975
Where did you learn
a phrase like that?

00:46:53.275 --> 00:46:57.145
You're the one who said
my Korean wasn't very good.

00:46:57.715 --> 00:46:58.985
So I've been studying.

00:47:00.055 --> 00:47:01.255
Good for you.

00:47:01.625 --> 00:47:04.325
A good-looking foreigner like you
who also speaks Korean well?

00:47:04.485 --> 00:47:06.095
That's a killer combination.

00:47:06.095 --> 00:47:07.195
So cute.

00:47:08.295 --> 00:47:11.695
If you have some free time,
could you be my tour guide?

00:47:11.765 --> 00:47:14.965
- I've been wanting to see Namsan.
- A tour guide?

00:47:15.965 --> 00:47:18.905
Of course. From Namsan
to K-barbecue pork belly,

00:47:18.975 --> 00:47:20.775
I'll give you a full-course tour.

00:47:20.775 --> 00:47:22.545
I like pork belly too.

00:47:23.705 --> 00:47:25.875
Mr. Oh, did you say something?

00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:28.815
What? Nothing.

00:47:29.015 --> 00:47:31.615
The trash. I said
I'm going to take out the trash.

00:47:32.985 --> 00:47:35.585
No, it's...
I said we'd do it together later.

00:47:35.655 --> 00:47:36.855
- Oh, no, it's fine.
- Ji Song.

00:47:38.725 --> 00:47:41.725
If you're ever having a hard time,
you have to call me.

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.495
We're close enough for that.

00:47:43.825 --> 00:47:45.165
We're friends, after all.

00:47:47.695 --> 00:47:48.765
Okay.

00:47:57.475 --> 00:47:58.675
Mr. Oh!

00:47:59.775 --> 00:48:00.975
I said we should do it together.

00:48:01.075 --> 00:48:02.985
No, I'm fine. Why did you come out?

00:48:02.985 --> 00:48:05.055
- Let me...
- Oh, no, it's okay.

00:48:05.915 --> 00:48:07.115
Still,

00:48:07.515 --> 00:48:08.825
thank you.

00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:13.695
Isn't Wei Lin waiting for you?

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.965
He left.

00:48:16.795 --> 00:48:17.995
He left?

00:48:19.935 --> 00:48:23.105
Couldn't he stay a bit longer?
Why was he in such a rush?

00:48:24.465 --> 00:48:27.435
He has his own life.
I guess he had other plans.

00:48:28.175 --> 00:48:30.545
What plans could be more important
than seeing you, Ji Song?

00:48:31.005 --> 00:48:33.145
And what's this about him
having his own life?

00:48:34.015 --> 00:48:35.045
Excuse me?

00:48:42.455 --> 00:48:44.555
Ji Song.
I'm no longer an assistant manager.

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:45.595
I'm a team leader now.

00:48:45.925 --> 00:48:47.495
Mr. Song resigned recently,

00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:49.295
so I got promoted.
I'm Team Leader Oh now.

00:48:49.295 --> 00:48:51.965
Really?
Why are you only telling me now?

00:48:52.035 --> 00:48:53.165
Remember a while ago...

00:48:53.165 --> 00:48:55.265
when I couldn't come
to the shop for three days?

00:48:55.335 --> 00:48:57.705
I was getting a gallstone removed.

00:48:57.705 --> 00:48:59.505
I had a big polyp right here.

00:48:59.575 --> 00:49:02.075
What? Why didn't you tell me?
Are you okay now?

00:49:02.175 --> 00:49:03.505
- And there's more.
- More?

00:49:03.645 --> 00:49:04.875
What else is there?

00:49:04.945 --> 00:49:06.145
Of course.

00:49:06.545 --> 00:49:09.285
I have a life of my own too.

00:49:09.945 --> 00:49:12.385
It's just not that important.

00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:16.185
I know this is going
to sound ridiculous,

00:49:16.825 --> 00:49:18.755
but no matter how much
I think about it,

00:49:19.455 --> 00:49:21.095
for me,

00:49:21.865 --> 00:49:22.995
nothing is more important than you.

00:49:25.065 --> 00:49:26.665
I don't even need a private life.

00:49:28.935 --> 00:49:30.435
In my life,

00:49:31.805 --> 00:49:33.435
there's nothing I want...

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:36.205
to be as devoted to as you.

00:49:37.375 --> 00:49:39.675
That's why I...

00:49:47.315 --> 00:49:48.555
Darn it.

00:49:48.955 --> 00:49:50.855
What is it? What's wrong?

00:49:50.985 --> 00:49:52.525
- What?
- I just feel so...

00:49:53.095 --> 00:49:56.495
- so pathetic.
- What?

00:49:56.495 --> 00:50:01.265
I know very well that I can't
compare to a great guy like Wei Lin.

00:50:01.265 --> 00:50:03.305
Yet, here I am
making this lame confession...

00:50:03.365 --> 00:50:05.735
- to try to win your heart.
- A confession?

00:50:07.205 --> 00:50:10.005
Wait, if we're already dating,
why would we need a confession?

00:50:11.405 --> 00:50:12.775
- What?
- What?

00:50:12.845 --> 00:50:14.275
- What?
- What?

00:50:14.815 --> 00:50:17.245
Wait. We're date...

00:50:17.315 --> 00:50:18.485
We're dating...

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:20.215
Are we dating?

00:50:21.855 --> 00:50:24.025
You mean we haven't been?

00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:25.795
- What?
- What?

00:50:29.525 --> 00:50:33.635
Then why do you think I said that
a year ago?

00:50:36.005 --> 00:50:37.065
Never did I think...

00:50:37.905 --> 00:50:40.605
I'd get butterflies for you, Mr. Oh.

00:50:41.675 --> 00:50:42.675
Well...

00:50:42.945 --> 00:50:43.945
So that...

00:50:45.215 --> 00:50:46.575
So that meant...

00:50:47.645 --> 00:50:50.115
- Mr. Oh!
- Gosh. Yes?

00:50:50.115 --> 00:50:51.915
What were we this whole time?

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.015
Then,

00:50:53.085 --> 00:50:54.515
what were you doing all this time?

00:50:54.715 --> 00:50:55.885
If we weren't even dating,

00:50:55.955 --> 00:50:57.155
why were you helping at the shop?

00:50:57.155 --> 00:50:58.425
Why'd you walk me home every day?

00:50:58.625 --> 00:51:00.095
That's because...

00:51:00.355 --> 00:51:01.355
That's because...

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:04.965
No, but even so,
that doesn't mean we were dating...

00:51:05.235 --> 00:51:06.635
That's not what dating is, is it?

00:51:06.965 --> 00:51:09.205
I've never even held your hand.

00:51:09.465 --> 00:51:12.675
That's because
I figured that was just you.

00:51:12.735 --> 00:51:15.175
I figured you were
taking things slow.

00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:19.045
Then hold my hand now.

00:51:22.515 --> 00:51:23.585
Wait.

00:51:25.285 --> 00:51:27.085
I've never even hugged you.

00:51:29.455 --> 00:51:30.825
Then hug me now.

00:51:33.795 --> 00:51:34.825
And...

00:51:36.625 --> 00:51:37.765
there's still...

00:51:38.125 --> 00:51:40.565
one more thing we haven't done.

00:51:40.765 --> 00:51:41.905
What?

00:51:53.075 --> 00:51:56.215
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.
What am I even doing?

00:51:58.015 --> 00:51:59.015
Oh, my.

00:52:03.185 --> 00:52:04.355
Are you crying?

00:52:05.895 --> 00:52:08.155
No, don't cry. This isn't the time.

00:52:08.665 --> 00:52:09.695
If you cry, I'm leaving.

00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:11.695
- I'm going to leave!
- No.

00:52:17.005 --> 00:52:18.035
Of course not.

00:52:21.175 --> 00:52:22.675
I'm not that...

00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:26.075
pathetic.

00:52:51.405 --> 00:52:53.635
(Ham Ji Woo Solo Concert)

00:52:59.745 --> 00:53:01.115
I can't take this.

00:53:15.665 --> 00:53:20.195
In a corner of the dawn sky

00:53:21.495 --> 00:53:26.105
Suddenly, a shooting star appears

00:53:26.375 --> 00:53:29.245
And in the blink of an eye

00:53:29.445 --> 00:53:32.115
Right above my head

00:53:32.415 --> 00:53:37.445
Pouring down like rain

00:53:37.945 --> 00:53:42.555
Oh, what a beautiful day

00:53:42.785 --> 00:53:47.225
Even the sun and the moon
are on my side

00:53:47.225 --> 00:53:49.695
Shining just for me

00:53:49.695 --> 00:53:54.295
Oh, be my salvation

00:53:54.695 --> 00:53:58.875
In my empty heart

00:53:58.905 --> 00:54:04.375
It's full of stars

00:54:07.315 --> 00:54:09.615
You're my xylophone

00:54:09.615 --> 00:54:12.085
You're my ding-dong-daeng

00:54:12.355 --> 00:54:16.525
If it makes you happy
I could be a trainee every day

00:54:16.655 --> 00:54:18.925
You're my xylophone

00:54:18.925 --> 00:54:20.855
You're my ding-dong-daeng

00:54:20.855 --> 00:54:24.165
You make me sing

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:32.075
I can't erase that feeling

00:54:32.075 --> 00:54:37.675
I'm dizzy
like a shimmering heat haze

00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:43.385
My faltering steps always before you

00:54:43.385 --> 00:54:48.825
I'm so dizzy, I'm reeling

00:54:56.095 --> 00:55:00.965
On this long and winding road

00:55:01.935 --> 00:55:05.705
My weary heart

00:55:06.275 --> 00:55:09.075
Searched for a place to rest

00:55:10.105 --> 00:55:14.345
Letting out a sigh

00:55:15.115 --> 00:55:18.285
On that lonely night

00:55:20.385 --> 00:55:25.255
Like a warm and gentle greeting

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:30.765
You're the one I still long for

00:55:31.625 --> 00:55:33.895
I'm done trying harder!

00:55:34.265 --> 00:55:37.535
With you, all right?

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:41.235
Jung Da Hae.
You have more than I do.

00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:44.645
So don't avoid me.

00:55:46.615 --> 00:55:48.015
So now you're being punished.

00:55:52.885 --> 00:55:54.355
You, Dr. Ham,

00:55:54.355 --> 00:55:57.885
dreaming of you is a special treat
I have to save up for these days.

00:56:00.955 --> 00:56:03.525
Will you marry me?

00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:28.755
So, what did you think?

00:56:29.785 --> 00:56:32.295
I thought it was even better live
than the studio version.

00:56:34.295 --> 00:56:37.265
Well, yes. I liked it.

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:40.895
If you did,
why didn't you get married?

00:56:42.305 --> 00:56:43.335
Excuse me?

00:56:44.165 --> 00:56:46.275
I was so curious to see
what you looked like.

00:56:47.235 --> 00:56:48.435
And now I finally get to meet you.

00:56:50.175 --> 00:56:53.015
- Are you perhaps...
- Ji Woo finally seems happy.

00:56:54.615 --> 00:56:56.215
And I think it's all thanks to you.

00:56:58.485 --> 00:56:59.515
Thank you.

00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:05.955
Wait...

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:23.375
Hey, Ji Song.

00:57:23.475 --> 00:57:26.645
Da Hae! I just heard from Eun Sang.

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.825
I will use the driver from now on
when I hit you.

00:57:44.025 --> 00:57:45.465
A fan of yours gave you this.

00:57:47.865 --> 00:57:49.035
What is this?

00:57:58.745 --> 00:58:01.045
You're the leading man now.

00:58:01.545 --> 00:58:04.245
Congratulations.
I'll always be rooting for you.

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:11.125
(Small Theater)

00:58:28.635 --> 00:58:29.705
Hey, guys.

00:58:30.205 --> 00:58:33.215
This morning, I couldn't get
the lid off the strawberry jam,

00:58:33.475 --> 00:58:35.615
and I almost popped my own lid.

00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:36.945
But then...

00:58:41.715 --> 00:58:44.155
Sweetheart, when did you
get so strong?

00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:46.425
From eating and playing a lot.

00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:49.425
Where could you play? It's so cold.

00:58:49.695 --> 00:58:52.165
It must be freezing where you are.

00:58:52.535 --> 00:58:54.895
What? What are you
talking about, Mom?

00:58:55.095 --> 00:58:56.665
Spring came a long time ago.

00:58:57.205 --> 00:58:58.665
The whole world is full of spring.

00:58:59.075 --> 00:59:00.135
What?

00:59:12.655 --> 00:59:15.985
You cried so much, Mom,
that all the ice melted away.

00:59:17.755 --> 00:59:18.785
Ji Sang...

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:23.795
It's warm now, Mom.

00:59:24.425 --> 00:59:26.465
So you should go out
and have fun now, Mom.

00:59:26.865 --> 00:59:28.695
See? Go on out and play.

00:59:31.835 --> 00:59:33.135
That's when I realized.

00:59:33.575 --> 00:59:36.705
That maybe my grief
had started to fade.

00:59:38.245 --> 00:59:41.315
And that maybe, I could start over.

00:59:45.045 --> 00:59:48.555
So with that in mind, I'm thinking
we could have some fun again.

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:51.385
What should we name
our new playground?

00:59:51.785 --> 00:59:52.925
- Ji Song.
- Eun Sang Town?

00:59:52.925 --> 00:59:54.455
- Da Hae.
- Ji Sang Villa?

00:59:55.495 --> 00:59:57.625
Or what about Average Street?

00:59:58.725 --> 01:00:00.935
Honestly, I haven't picked a name,

01:00:02.135 --> 01:00:04.735
so let's take our time
and build it together.

01:00:06.305 --> 01:00:08.505
So guys, come on over and play.

01:00:18.045 --> 01:00:20.785
Ji Song, did you bring
the rent money?

01:00:23.385 --> 01:00:24.455
Da Hae.

01:00:25.825 --> 01:00:28.855
- Eun Sang!
- Eun Sang!

01:00:29.595 --> 01:00:31.165
Eun Sang is back.

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.695
I missed you.

01:00:43.105 --> 01:00:44.175
How was it?

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:45.745
Did you have a good time?

01:00:47.315 --> 01:00:49.085
I cried my heart out.

01:00:49.615 --> 01:00:50.945
Are you feeling better now?

01:00:52.885 --> 01:00:54.015
I'm okay.

01:00:55.825 --> 01:00:56.985
I want to be okay.

01:00:58.685 --> 01:00:59.755
But...

01:01:00.525 --> 01:01:04.525
some grief is meant to be unpacked
a little at a time, over a lifetime.

01:01:11.905 --> 01:01:13.235
What about you two?

01:01:13.635 --> 01:01:15.975
Has life changed at all
after you made money?

01:01:16.345 --> 01:01:19.275
Well, as they say,
money makes money.

01:01:19.775 --> 01:01:21.775
Our shop is the most popular one
in the neighborhood.

01:01:23.115 --> 01:01:25.615
- Maybe I should raise the rent.
- No.

01:01:28.015 --> 01:01:30.085
I'm pretty much the same.

01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:34.025
I eat, work, sleep,
and rest now and then.

01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:36.295
I deal with people's drama.

01:01:38.225 --> 01:01:40.865
But after making money,

01:01:41.235 --> 01:01:44.465
I feel like I have the strength
to look forward to tomorrow.

01:01:44.765 --> 01:01:46.035
Yes.

01:01:46.205 --> 01:01:48.905
Lately, I get excited for
what each new day will bring.

01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:53.815
Are you sure it's just tomorrow
you're looking forward to?

01:01:54.775 --> 01:01:55.945
Is it just tomorrow?

01:01:56.845 --> 01:01:57.845
Come on.

01:01:59.855 --> 01:02:01.915
What are you talking about?
Seriously.

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:03.085
- Are you sure it's just tomorrow...
- Let's ask again.

01:02:03.085 --> 01:02:04.225
you're looking forward to?

01:02:07.195 --> 01:02:08.455
Hey, didn't you two break up?

01:02:08.755 --> 01:02:10.925
- Should I just say it?
- You don't have to.

01:02:13.835 --> 01:02:15.065
Yes, sir.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:17.065
Yes, the seminar went well.

01:02:18.465 --> 01:02:20.375
No, I'm heading out from here.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.805
I have somewhere to stop by.

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:25.345
Just because.

01:02:25.845 --> 01:02:27.875
Maybe because I need
a little mental reset?

01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:19.965
What?

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:29.075
You...

01:03:30.505 --> 01:03:32.075
You really are a piece of work,
aren't you?

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:36.115
- Dr. Ham.
- After a year, you'd just leave?

01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:39.915
Something came up that day.

01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:43.955
But I didn't just disappear.
I left you a card.

01:03:43.955 --> 01:03:45.555
Leaving a lingering note like that?

01:03:46.025 --> 01:03:48.395
I seriously thought we were over.

01:03:48.595 --> 01:03:52.095
I thought we were leads in a movie
with an open ending.

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:53.435
No, what are you talking about?

01:03:54.635 --> 01:03:55.965
I just...

01:03:56.605 --> 01:03:59.675
Like you rooted for me, Dr. Ham,
I wanted to do the same for you.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:21.825
Why are you about to cry?
I missed you so much.

01:04:25.065 --> 01:04:26.095
Liar.

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.265
It's true.

01:04:30.505 --> 01:04:32.205
I wanted to call you overseas
every single night.

01:04:32.775 --> 01:04:34.675
Do you have any idea how hard
I had to fight that urge?

01:04:38.305 --> 01:04:39.375
No, can't say I do.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.145
And plane tickets...

01:04:41.415 --> 01:04:44.715
Every day, I'd get to the buy button
and barely stop myself.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:46.955
- Do you get it now?
- And I'm telling you, I didn't.

01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:49.325
You have no idea
how much I missed you.

01:04:49.825 --> 01:04:51.785
It got so bad
I started seeing things.

01:04:53.595 --> 01:04:56.765
I thought I was going crazy
from studying too hard.

01:04:58.865 --> 01:04:59.965
What's with you?

01:05:00.565 --> 01:05:03.365
I'm over here pouring my heart out
about how much I missed you,

01:05:03.635 --> 01:05:05.205
and you give me nothing.

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.945
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're making me nervous.

01:05:10.745 --> 01:05:12.615
Maybe it's because
you're talking too much?

01:05:13.675 --> 01:05:14.675
Excuse me?

01:05:40.505 --> 01:05:41.835
So, your ambition...

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:43.475
Have you fulfilled it all?

01:05:44.405 --> 01:05:45.675
And your dream...

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:47.875
Did you achieve it?

01:05:49.315 --> 01:05:50.485
No.

01:05:51.715 --> 01:05:52.955
There's one I haven't fulfilled yet.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.085
You, Dr. Ham.

01:05:57.885 --> 01:05:59.295
You...

01:06:00.195 --> 01:06:02.625
are the one dream I've been saving.

01:06:04.295 --> 01:06:05.365
So...

01:06:06.935 --> 01:06:09.195
let me keep on dreaming.

01:06:13.075 --> 01:06:14.235
Well, then...

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:19.715
Why don't you put this on?

01:06:51.005 --> 01:06:52.075
I love you,

01:06:52.645 --> 01:06:53.675
Ham Ji Woo.

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:46.795
A story like this one.

01:07:47.095 --> 01:07:52.665
So, how should the story
of those who desired more end?

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:57.005
Being punished for their greed,

01:07:57.345 --> 01:07:59.445
would a bad ending like that
be natural?

01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:02.345
Life never goes the way you expect,

01:08:02.575 --> 01:08:06.155
and we're ready to enjoy
even its unpredictable moments.

01:08:07.215 --> 01:08:09.885
So I'd call this a happy ending
for everyone.

01:08:10.185 --> 01:08:11.755
And why not?

01:08:12.385 --> 01:08:13.655
Don't we have that opening event
next week?

01:08:13.725 --> 01:08:14.925
Aren't you taking it a bit too easy?

01:08:15.355 --> 01:08:16.365
Gosh, it's so bitter.

01:08:17.395 --> 01:08:18.425
And sour.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.435
That's weird.

01:08:20.495 --> 01:08:23.265
Why do I get a bad feeling
from its smell?

01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:26.675
Coffee's supposed to be bitter.

01:08:26.805 --> 01:08:28.605
Just drink what you're given.

01:08:29.575 --> 01:08:30.605
Mr. Ko Dae Young.

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:32.345
Yes, boss.

01:08:33.445 --> 01:08:35.115
- Wait, I thought he was the boss.
- I don't know who's who anymore.

01:08:35.175 --> 01:08:36.615
What can I get for you?

01:08:40.555 --> 01:08:41.755
Make me another one.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:44.025
One that's tastier and more popular.

01:08:44.025 --> 01:08:45.025
Basically,

01:08:45.025 --> 01:08:47.595
- a better one!
- A better one!

01:09:07.315 --> 01:09:10.285
(To the Moon)

01:10:46.745 --> 01:10:52.245
(Thank you for watching
and supporting To the Moon.)

01:10:52.245 --> 01:10:57.355
(We will root for your journey
to your own moon as well.)

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.665
