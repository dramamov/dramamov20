00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:03.025
Hey!

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:04.225
Over here!

00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:08.105
Over here!

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.185
We are here!

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:14.625
Hey!

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:18.865
Where is Non?

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:21.105
Non! Non!

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:24.345
We are here!

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:36.225
Non?

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.145
Non?

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:48.345
Did it catch up to us?

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:50.065
I don't know.

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.305
How would I know?

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.785
I ran here with you.

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:02.025
I think we're safe now.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:37.665
Can you swim?

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:40.305
Yeah. Why do you ask?

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:44.785
Jump into the water.
Dive as deep as you can.

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:45.825
What?

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:46.905
Hurry!

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:50.865
Damn!

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:53.465
Get in that pool!

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:55.225
Jump now!

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:48.145
Pao.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:50.705
It's going to be okay.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:53.825
I'll be here. I'm not leaving you.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:55.545
-Pao.
-Jean.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:56.745
Jean!

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.145
Phu, you go up first.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.065
Tell them not to wait for me.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:05.905
No!

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.745
You guys get out of here!

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:09.225
Leave me alone!

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.185
What are you talking about, Pao?

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:14.145
I'm your big brother.

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:15.825
How can I leave you?

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:20.265
But I'm dying.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:24.785
I'm not gonna survive this.

00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:34.745
You will survive with me.

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:39.345
-Pao! Pao!
-Hey!

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:41.305
Go away!

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:42.705
Let go of me!

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:45.545
Stop it!

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.385
Leave me! Let go of me!

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:49.025
Pao, stop! I said stop!

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:49.985
Pao!

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.345
This isn't a bite mark, Pao.

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:24.345
Kawin!

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.505
Come on!

00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:38.225
Win!

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.065
Who were you running from?

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:43.385
Who?

00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:45.665
Answer me, who is that?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.745
Lily.

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:00.825
-Lily!
-Sun! Wait!

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:02.185
Hey, Sun!

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:06.225
We made it!

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:07.345
We will survive!

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.505
Help us!

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:13.145
Wait.

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:14.385
Where's Ning?

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:18.185
Hey! Where's Ning?

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:21.545
Non?

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:36.425
Run! Get out of here!

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:39.225
They're coming this way! Get out!

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:06.025
-Go!
-Hurry!

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:08.825
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:13.185
-What are you running from?
-Back off!

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:16.025
Look! This is a misunderstanding.

00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:17.385
Pao wasn't bitten.

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:19.145
You bastard! I don't buy it.

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.985
Damn you! They're scratches!
You can check if you want!

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:25.865
Hey, Thi!

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:34.105
It's true!

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:41.825
Damn it!

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:43.185
They heard gunshots.

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:44.305
What gunshots?

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:49.105
Let's go! Move! Hurry!

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:50.545
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:51.665
Go!

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:52.825
-Hurry!
-Go!

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:53.985
Hurry!

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:26.185
Pao.

00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:27.105
Pao!

00:07:27.985 --> 00:07:29.425
-Pao, stay away!
-Pao!

00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:31.145
No, Pao.

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:00.745
Fah.

00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:07.465
I'm sorry.

00:08:10.705 --> 00:08:11.705
Fah.

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:16.425
I'm really sorry.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.545
Pao.

00:08:50.025 --> 00:08:51.505
Hey! Hurry up! This way!

00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:53.065
Hurry up!

00:08:54.465 --> 00:08:55.825
I said hurry up! Damn it!

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:56.945
Hurry!

00:08:57.985 --> 00:08:59.385
What are you waiting for?

00:08:59.465 --> 00:09:00.425
-Pao!
-This way!

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:01.865
Pao! Come on! This way!

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.345
-Pao.
-Let's move!

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:04.625
Pao!

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:06.025
Hurry up!

00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:07.305
Let her go.

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:10.145
You go there.

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:30.625
I'm sorry.

00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:26.465
4 MONTHS AGO

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:05.025
PROFESSOR, THE RESULT
TURNED OUT VERY WELL.

00:12:05.105 --> 00:12:08.065
GOOD JOB, NING. GET SOME REST.
WE'LL CATCH UP AFTER NEW YEAR.

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:52.025
It was an accident.
No one wanted it to happen.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:54.545
An accident?

00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:58.425
How many times do my mom and I
have to go though this?

00:12:58.505 --> 00:13:01.265
-They should just die so this can stop.
-Ning.

00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:05.865
-Why are you talking like that?
-Why shouldn't I?

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.665
Jean and I warned you about this
since junior year.

00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:10.985
We said our backup
power supply is very old.

00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:13.705
And you waited until everything
went to hell? Huh?

00:13:13.785 --> 00:13:15.425
And that's when we get a new one?

00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:17.305
And I can't tell anyone

00:13:17.385 --> 00:13:19.545
since it's a top-secret mission.

00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:23.665
Brilliant!

00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:26.025
Let it just crash and burn!

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:33.905
Are you done?

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:35.945
You feel better now?

00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:38.745
Can we fix this problem now?

00:13:40.785 --> 00:13:42.625
Sure! Let's fix it now.

00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:45.105
But first, answer my question.

00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:49.065
Given how little time we have,
where can we find the Cryptobenticfit?

00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:52.345
Did you see the news
about the oil spill a week ago?

00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:54.305
Now the issue has gone quiet.

00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:56.585
Any guesses on who did it?

00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:02.105
Was that an accident, too?

00:14:02.185 --> 00:14:03.145
It was, wasn't it?

00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:27.465
I'm sorry.

00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:30.785
You don't need to apologize.

00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:35.185
I have no idea how to answer you.

00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:47.825
The corals are all dead.

00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:49.825
The red tide, too.

00:14:51.585 --> 00:14:54.025
I don't know how
we can find Cryptobenticfit.

00:14:56.265 --> 00:15:00.225
We need to find something else
with a metabolic rate just as high.

00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:03.425
I will find a way.

00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:06.665
Can I be honest with you?

00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:09.665
Even if our backup
power supply doesn't fail,

00:15:09.745 --> 00:15:12.025
I'm not sure we can finish it on time.

00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:15.785
We have to test on mice and monkeys,
not on humans yet.

00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:16.745
Ning.

00:15:19.425 --> 00:15:20.665
That is not our job.

00:15:21.945 --> 00:15:25.345
Our job is just to make sure
that we finish it on time.

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:27.625
Let the higher-ups handle the rest.

00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:31.545
Are we not being forced
to turn a blind eye?

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:34.825
Anything else I should know?

00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:36.105
No, Ning.

00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:38.505
You're overthinking.

00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:41.225
You should get some rest.

00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:50.145
I've isolated my mother's and Joe's cells
and kept them in the petri dish.

00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:52.065
And what's next?

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.185
I think something's off.

00:15:55.945 --> 00:15:58.865
The cell's energy consumption
shouldn't be this low.

00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:03.145
There is something
that makes the cell's metabolic rate--

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:04.105
Ning.

00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:09.425
This is a new disease.
There is nothing normal.

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.825
And as humans,
we don't need to know every single thing.

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.425
Focus on what's in front of you.

00:16:16.385 --> 00:16:17.945
Focus on what we're doing.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.105
Just let them in.

00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.025
We'll go with this.

00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:37.985
Just think, you and Non
can take a graduation photo with Mom.

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:39.705
Focus on that.

00:16:39.785 --> 00:16:41.065
And that's it.

00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:42.425
You got it?

00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:45.345
Yeah.

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.424
The Patron has acknowledged it.

00:17:08.985 --> 00:17:10.065
And what did he say?

00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:16.105
Let's be real for a second.

00:17:17.424 --> 00:17:18.785
What are the chances?

00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:28.265
Joe's condition
is getting worse by the day.

00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:32.105
-Have you checked the latest lab result?
-We're trying.

00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:34.665
What does Ning know so far?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:38.785
She's just curious.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

00:17:38.865 --> 00:17:41.665
No. It's clear that you can't.

00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:51.185
-Let me talk to the Patron.
-No.

00:17:52.345 --> 00:17:53.705
He let me make the decision.

00:17:54.425 --> 00:17:55.385
Phao,

00:17:56.185 --> 00:17:58.185
I can confirm.

00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:01.825
We are working on it.

00:18:02.265 --> 00:18:05.065
I've been doing my best on this project
from the start.

00:18:06.345 --> 00:18:10.705
Dr. Kanchana would never give me
a project that was going to fail.

00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:14.345
I think her expectations of you
were too high.

00:18:19.585 --> 00:18:20.585
Give me one week.

00:18:21.785 --> 00:18:23.945
If I can't fix it, do whatever you want.

00:18:24.025 --> 00:18:25.905
-Three days.
-Phao!

00:18:26.465 --> 00:18:30.345
If you can't fix it,
the Patron will end this project.

00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:32.105
That's the end of it.

00:18:33.865 --> 00:18:37.625
I don't believe he will let his son die.

00:18:43.105 --> 00:18:45.785
He couldn't care less
whether you believe it or not.

00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:49.585
He believes that…

00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:54.705
you would never let Dr. Kanchana die.

00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:58.025
Isn't he right?

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:08.705
Three days.

00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.225
And get rid of Ning.

00:19:11.745 --> 00:19:14.145
From now on, it's just you and yourself.

00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:31.145
Hell yeah!

00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:34.905
PRESENT DAY

00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:36.465
Dang.

00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:40.065
I never thought that one day
I would do something like this.

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:41.825
Go ahead. Take whatever you want.

00:19:43.345 --> 00:19:44.825
Why do they only have Ichitan?

00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:47.385
Because they are the sponsor.

00:19:48.425 --> 00:19:49.465
Sponsor what?

00:19:49.865 --> 00:19:50.945
They sponsor this gym.

00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:54.025
Go for it. What are you waiting for?

00:20:00.505 --> 00:20:01.745
Be careful.

00:20:04.225 --> 00:20:06.505
Hell yeah! We will not die of hunger.

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.985
Hey. Are you okay?

00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:15.585
Eat this if you're hungry.

00:21:21.705 --> 00:21:22.705
Here.

00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:28.865
Do you need anything else?

00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:31.265
This is enough. Thank you.

00:21:31.345 --> 00:21:34.105
Can Earth and I sit here to accompany you?

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:36.225
So you won't be lonely.

00:21:56.985 --> 00:21:58.065
Hey!

00:22:00.905 --> 00:22:03.825
Dig in. Do you want to starve to death?

00:22:44.945 --> 00:22:46.505
Do you know how to use it?

00:23:04.545 --> 00:23:05.705
Yeah, a little bit.

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:14.185
Don't doubt it.

00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:17.265
I am a sport shooter.

00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:22.745
This is all we have left.

00:23:24.585 --> 00:23:29.105
And two guns. One is with me
and the other is with my friend, Korn.

00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:35.665
If you think this gun
will do you any good, you're wrong.

00:23:35.745 --> 00:23:39.825
A single gunshot
could draw hundreds of them to you.

00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:42.585
How do you know?

00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:46.465
Have you done it before?

00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:48.825
Do you wanna try?

00:23:54.385 --> 00:23:56.865
Didn't you hear
the announcement yesterday?

00:24:02.865 --> 00:24:04.185
Of course, I did.

00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:06.545
Why didn't you join us?

00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:11.985
Why the hell should I? Huh? Why should I?

00:24:12.065 --> 00:24:15.825
Did you even count
how many people you've lost?

00:24:22.505 --> 00:24:23.985
That was my idea.

00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:28.625
I announced it and called
the other survivors to the library.

00:24:43.105 --> 00:24:46.545
What now? Won't the government
come and rescue us?

00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:51.465
Why did they tell us
to wait on the roof deck?

00:24:55.225 --> 00:24:57.345
Ever seen the series The Last of Us?

00:25:00.545 --> 00:25:03.825
Everyone in the risk zone
could be a carrier.

00:25:05.145 --> 00:25:10.145
Once the virus spreads to a certain point,
you can't tell who's infected.

00:25:11.585 --> 00:25:14.745
Wiping out the entire high-risk group
is the safer move.

00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:16.225
Otherwise it's hopeless.

00:25:16.305 --> 00:25:19.705
If we return and the virus spreads again,
it'll be a nightmare.

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:23.185
They never wanted
to save us in the first place.

00:25:24.345 --> 00:25:26.945
They tricked you all
into going up there to be killed.

00:25:27.385 --> 00:25:28.345
Correct.

00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:31.865
But do you know the worst part?

00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:41.265
We did exactly the same thing to Pao
that they did to us.

00:25:50.105 --> 00:25:51.305
I don't think so.

00:25:52.225 --> 00:25:54.145
If it wasn't for that smart-ass,

00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:57.865
I might have more time, don't you think?

00:25:58.665 --> 00:25:59.945
What is it, Prao?

00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:03.025
Your sister brought those fucking zombies.

00:26:03.105 --> 00:26:06.145
Hey! They open fired on us
before the zombies came out.

00:26:06.225 --> 00:26:08.905
Will you stop taking your sister's side?

00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:10.425
Just admit it.

00:26:10.545 --> 00:26:14.465
If she wasn't trying to be
all righteous last night,

00:26:14.545 --> 00:26:16.265
we would be on the helipad.

00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:19.665
Didn't you all see?
The zombies ran to another place!

00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:22.025
Hey! They are going to kill all of us.

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:23.785
Screw everything.

00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:27.425
I was talking about Lily, stupid!

00:26:28.025 --> 00:26:31.265
Have you already forgotten?
She's a general's daughter.

00:26:31.345 --> 00:26:33.225
If she was still alive,

00:26:33.305 --> 00:26:35.825
do you really think
they would dare to shoot us?

00:26:37.865 --> 00:26:39.185
Think carefully, Non.

00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:41.745
Your sister's smart-ass attitude…

00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:46.145
got so many of us killed.

00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:52.865
Lily, Kawin, Fah.

00:26:53.465 --> 00:26:54.985
Shut the fuck up already.

00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:59.025
Say one more word…

00:27:00.825 --> 00:27:02.105
and I'll kill you.

00:27:06.785 --> 00:27:08.545
Will you kill each other?

00:27:09.185 --> 00:27:10.105
I've got a gun.

00:27:19.705 --> 00:27:21.105
Let me ask you a question.

00:27:22.545 --> 00:27:25.465
Didn't you just say
that the zombies went to another place?

00:27:27.745 --> 00:27:28.865
I filmed it.

00:27:30.185 --> 00:27:31.145
Let me see.

00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:58.825
What's the furthest your camera can zoom?

00:28:00.825 --> 00:28:02.225
Why?

00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:47.025
KANCHANA - PRINT AND CUT

00:28:47.105 --> 00:28:48.425
September?

00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:51.425
What picture?

00:29:05.145 --> 00:29:06.345
Jellyfish?

00:29:10.305 --> 00:29:13.105
Jellyfish? Why?

00:29:15.625 --> 00:29:16.985
Jellyfish? Why?

00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:34.785
Why?

00:29:41.145 --> 00:29:42.145
Damn it.

00:29:49.865 --> 00:29:52.385
Phao, I need something right now.

00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:56.385
Find it for me as soon as possible.

00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:59.185
-A pack leader?
-Yeah.

00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:01.265
Last night we followed them.

00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:03.225
They went to the main auditorium.

00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:04.985
Huh? What for?

00:30:06.145 --> 00:30:06.985
Oh.

00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:08.545
How many of them were there?

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:09.945
A lot.

00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:11.505
Maybe 100.

00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:12.585
More than that.

00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:15.585
When we got out, I saw more coming.

00:30:15.665 --> 00:30:17.145
Did you go in there?

00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:19.505
You idiot, who would go in there?

00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:23.105
We went to the second floor
and peeked through the window.

00:30:24.025 --> 00:30:25.265
I saw them huddled up.

00:30:25.665 --> 00:30:28.705
It's like they were planning something.

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:32.065
But what I'm certain about
is that one of them

00:30:32.865 --> 00:30:34.545
popped up in the middle.

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:37.665
Why would the one popped up
in the middle be the pack leader?

00:30:37.745 --> 00:30:40.145
Like I said,
one of them popped up in the middle

00:30:40.785 --> 00:30:42.225
while the rest

00:30:42.905 --> 00:30:44.665
were just wandering around.

00:30:48.665 --> 00:30:50.625
What if it wasn't a pack leader?

00:30:50.705 --> 00:30:53.065
That's why we need to go back
to double-check.

00:30:55.305 --> 00:30:56.985
What the fuck? Are you for real?

00:30:57.505 --> 00:30:58.865
That's not going to happen.

00:30:59.185 --> 00:31:00.945
It's too dangerous.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.545
Do we have any other choice?

00:31:02.985 --> 00:31:04.625
We need to survive in this place.

00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:06.785
If we don't do anything…

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.825
the only thing waiting for us is death.

00:31:15.425 --> 00:31:17.825
If you ask me, we should fight back.

00:31:19.825 --> 00:31:20.985
You're right.

00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:26.105
If that thing is the pack leader,

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:27.865
we have to find a way to kill it!

00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:31.985
For fuck's sake! From idiots to crazies.

00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:34.105
Aek, that's impossible.

00:31:34.625 --> 00:31:38.185
This is not a game.
We kill the boss, and everything is over.

00:31:38.265 --> 00:31:41.505
What will happen
if someone messes with the pack leader?

00:31:41.585 --> 00:31:44.025
But we don't know for sure

00:31:44.785 --> 00:31:46.785
if that's really their pack leader.

00:31:47.185 --> 00:31:49.625
Just to make sure, it should be fine.

00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:53.745
If they think that it's safe.

00:31:56.265 --> 00:31:57.265
I totally agree.

00:31:58.025 --> 00:32:00.825
What if a zombie unlocks the door
and enters the room?

00:32:03.545 --> 00:32:04.825
Huh?

00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:08.025
While I was in the library, I saw them…

00:32:13.745 --> 00:32:16.025
working like they did
when they were humans.

00:32:16.945 --> 00:32:19.425
-Remember the person who--
-Wait, wait!

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:20.705
Stop right there.

00:32:21.465 --> 00:32:23.545
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

00:32:24.145 --> 00:32:27.625
'Cause you said you'd already secured
all the doors!

00:32:27.705 --> 00:32:28.825
You stupid idiot!

00:32:30.185 --> 00:32:31.985
You're giving me a headache.

00:32:35.785 --> 00:32:36.825
Gus, Earth…

00:32:37.745 --> 00:32:40.305
-Go check all doors and windows.
-Sure thing!

00:32:40.705 --> 00:32:43.705
If anything's unlocked, lock it.

00:32:43.785 --> 00:32:46.665
For anything already locked,
lock them once more!

00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:56.305
The temperature matters.

00:32:59.865 --> 00:33:01.825
Guess what temperature I got.

00:33:03.465 --> 00:33:04.785
Forty-five degrees.

00:33:04.905 --> 00:33:07.705
-Does it have to do with the heat wave?
-It's related.

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:10.065
We're experiencing a heat wave now

00:33:10.145 --> 00:33:12.985
which makes
the usual temperature really high.

00:33:13.065 --> 00:33:14.945
I think this is the heat island effect.

00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:17.825
What's that?

00:33:18.945 --> 00:33:21.625
It's like you're trapped
inside a giant shell.

00:33:21.705 --> 00:33:24.105
And someone's setting fire all around it.

00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:29.025
I checked the temperature last night
when it was raining. 25 °C.

00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:35.225
But for now,
just be quiet and listen closely.

00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:54.265
-What's up with this?
-Right?

00:33:55.345 --> 00:33:58.065
There's no one left out there
for them to hunt.

00:33:58.145 --> 00:33:59.625
What is wrong with them?

00:34:00.465 --> 00:34:02.745
That's why temperature matters.

00:34:02.825 --> 00:34:05.905
Yesterday, while we were
running to the library before it rained,

00:34:05.985 --> 00:34:07.265
did you see them

00:34:07.985 --> 00:34:09.585
walking like they were giddy?

00:34:10.505 --> 00:34:12.264
Like they have no direction.

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:15.304
And then, they go stand in the lit area.

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:20.385
And when we saw them
moving inside the library?

00:34:20.465 --> 00:34:21.905
You remember, Thi?

00:34:23.304 --> 00:34:25.625
At that time,
it was still raining outside.

00:34:26.145 --> 00:34:28.585
How do I explain this to all of you?

00:34:28.665 --> 00:34:33.465
They were more like giddy people,
not zombies.

00:34:34.185 --> 00:34:38.145
It was like
they were sleepwalking or something…

00:34:38.865 --> 00:34:40.105
compared to now.

00:34:45.145 --> 00:34:46.264
But I don't know.

00:34:46.744 --> 00:34:48.344
Science kids, what do you think?

00:34:49.185 --> 00:34:52.545
From the information we have now,
it is possible…

00:34:53.505 --> 00:34:56.945
that hot weather makes them go crazier
than cold weather.

00:34:58.225 --> 00:35:01.185
Let's keep an eye on them
once again this evening.

00:35:02.705 --> 00:35:04.825
What if it's exactly like you said?

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:09.465
The weather will tell us when to move.

00:35:11.185 --> 00:35:13.665
Damn, bro! You're all super cool.

00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:15.065
What the hell?

00:35:15.145 --> 00:35:17.825
What are you so excited for?
Is now the time for that?

00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:20.225
Yep, sorry.

00:35:22.945 --> 00:35:23.945
Wait!

00:35:24.265 --> 00:35:25.185
Where is Pao?

00:35:25.785 --> 00:35:26.705
Pao.

00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:27.785
What?

00:35:27.865 --> 00:35:28.865
Fuck!

00:35:29.385 --> 00:35:31.025
Hey, everyone, stay here!

00:35:31.705 --> 00:35:33.505
I'll go after them! Stay here!

00:35:42.905 --> 00:35:44.345
Leave me!

00:35:44.425 --> 00:35:45.825
Pao, let go of me!

00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.265
-Die!
-Leave me!

00:35:55.145 --> 00:35:58.345
You son of a bitch!
I will kill you! I'll kill you!

00:35:58.425 --> 00:36:00.225
I will kill you!

00:36:00.865 --> 00:36:02.705
Let me go! I will kill you!

00:36:02.905 --> 00:36:04.225
Pao! Quiet!

00:36:04.305 --> 00:36:06.865
-They will come for us!
-Come then! Let them come!

00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:08.105
Fuck!

00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:10.025
-Calm down
-Come and eat us!

00:36:10.105 --> 00:36:11.025
Fuck you!

00:36:11.105 --> 00:36:12.025
Gus!

00:36:12.945 --> 00:36:14.465
I will fucking kill you!

00:36:15.905 --> 00:36:18.025
-I will kill you!
-Zombies will come for us!

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:19.385
Let them fucking come!

00:36:19.465 --> 00:36:21.265
You son of a bitch! You fucking--

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:44.705
Does it have to go this far?

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:47.785
Yes, it does! Can't you see
that he will get us all killed?

00:36:48.505 --> 00:36:50.945
This is not only because
of what he did to Gus,

00:36:51.025 --> 00:36:53.705
but also because
he also tried to call all the zombies.

00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:56.345
-He didn't mean to.
-He did it on purpose!

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:02.265
Fuck it!

00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:04.385
Non, bring me more of that!

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.505
Leave them all here.

00:37:11.105 --> 00:37:12.625
Ning.

00:37:12.705 --> 00:37:14.025
The wound is too big.

00:37:14.745 --> 00:37:15.745
We need to stitch it.

00:37:16.465 --> 00:37:17.945
Do you have any medical kits?

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:20.385
-Bring more.
-Help me with that.

00:37:23.705 --> 00:37:25.025
I can't take this.

00:37:25.105 --> 00:37:26.865
I know he's not in his right mind.

00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:30.265
But what's the point
of keeping him tied up like that?

00:37:30.345 --> 00:37:31.745
The point is to keep us safe.

00:37:32.265 --> 00:37:34.985
Letting him go outside
will be more dangerous.

00:37:35.065 --> 00:37:38.265
Do you ever think before speaking?
What if it was your brother?

00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:40.265
How would you feel?

00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:44.385
And, you, he is your brother.

00:37:45.025 --> 00:37:47.025
Is this really the only way?

00:37:53.985 --> 00:37:56.145
Pao just stopped taking his medications.

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.545
Did he go off his meds by himself?

00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:06.505
He was actually getting better…

00:38:09.345 --> 00:38:10.985
until this whole thing happened.

00:38:13.145 --> 00:38:14.105
But don't worry.

00:38:15.545 --> 00:38:17.505
I'm not gonna leave him like that.

00:38:19.265 --> 00:38:21.105
He just needs some time alone.

00:38:39.185 --> 00:38:40.825
If he loses it again…

00:38:42.225 --> 00:38:43.625
I swear I won't let him live.

00:38:43.705 --> 00:38:45.305
You've been warned.

00:39:10.945 --> 00:39:12.225
What are you doing?

00:39:15.265 --> 00:39:16.185
Nothing.

00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:18.785
Are you all right?

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.705
What kind of a question is that?
Are you stupid?

00:39:24.425 --> 00:39:26.625
Yeah. Super stupid.

00:39:29.665 --> 00:39:32.505
Go away then. Don't be a pain in the ass.

00:39:36.785 --> 00:39:38.025
Give me your hand.

00:39:39.265 --> 00:39:40.385
What?

00:39:40.465 --> 00:39:41.705
I already saw it.

00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:43.505
Let me see.

00:39:52.665 --> 00:39:55.145
Cover the wound
if you don't want anyone to see it.

00:39:55.225 --> 00:39:57.065
But be careful. It could get infected.

00:39:59.945 --> 00:40:00.905
Fucking nosy.

00:40:15.985 --> 00:40:17.265
They're already here!

00:40:18.225 --> 00:40:21.065
Hey! Guys, come here.
Come see this. Hurry!

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:35.985
Hey!

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:38.585
You come with me to prepare the camera!

00:40:39.745 --> 00:40:40.665
Sure.

00:40:41.185 --> 00:40:42.505
Where are you going?

00:40:42.825 --> 00:40:44.345
To the main auditorium.

00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:47.865
Seriously? After what just happened?
We have a wounded person.

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.225
We need one more person to go
instead of Gus.

00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:53.025
Jean, come with me.

00:40:53.105 --> 00:40:53.945
-No!
-No!

00:40:55.865 --> 00:40:56.825
I'll go with you.

00:40:56.905 --> 00:40:59.625
I'm not going. I'll be here with Gus.

00:40:59.705 --> 00:41:01.225
I can't trust these bastards.

00:41:01.305 --> 00:41:02.385
Stop it, all of you!

00:41:02.465 --> 00:41:04.265
My brother's not going anywhere!

00:41:05.065 --> 00:41:06.425
Just take the camera.

00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:08.665
Ning! Don't be like this.

00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:10.785
Listen carefully.

00:41:11.265 --> 00:41:12.385
If we don't go now…

00:41:13.345 --> 00:41:15.105
we have to wait all day tomorrow.

00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:18.225
Then wait. Why the hell
are you risking my brother's life?

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:19.985
I have been there before.

00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:22.825
We might not have this chance tomorrow.

00:41:22.905 --> 00:41:24.785
Then take the camera.

00:41:24.865 --> 00:41:26.065
Leave my brother here.

00:41:26.145 --> 00:41:27.145
Ning!

00:41:28.145 --> 00:41:31.865
We need four people.
We planned it already.

00:41:31.945 --> 00:41:33.665
This is to cover each other's backs.

00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:37.385
If one's holding the camera,
the other three can keep watch.

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:39.905
Count me in!

00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:41.185
Stop right there!

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:42.265
Why?

00:41:42.345 --> 00:41:45.425
We're not filming a zombie movie!
Get the hell away.

00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:48.745
You never believed in me.

00:41:50.545 --> 00:41:51.825
Why did you say that?

00:41:52.425 --> 00:41:54.025
This isn't about what I believe.

00:41:54.665 --> 00:41:57.025
-It's about safety.
-It's my safety.

00:41:57.545 --> 00:41:59.105
This is about my safety.

00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:01.505
My decision.

00:42:02.585 --> 00:42:04.065
Stay out of it, will you?

00:42:08.945 --> 00:42:10.185
I'll go with him.

00:42:14.225 --> 00:42:15.305
Don't worry.

00:42:16.905 --> 00:42:18.785
Thorn, you come with me.

00:42:19.145 --> 00:42:20.625
-What?
-Jean, Phu.

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:22.945
Stay and take care of the girls.

00:42:24.985 --> 00:42:26.025
Okay.

00:42:27.385 --> 00:42:29.265
We need to leave now.

00:42:29.545 --> 00:42:30.785
Go get your weapon.

00:42:36.745 --> 00:42:39.225
Take this. Just in case.

00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:42.065
But you need it more than I do.

00:42:42.505 --> 00:42:44.185
-I'm just here--
-Come on.

00:42:44.425 --> 00:42:45.345
Trust me.

00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:47.025
Take it.

00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:06.305
TWO MONTHS AGO

00:43:06.385 --> 00:43:08.865
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

00:43:09.745 --> 00:43:10.905
Here's the thing.

00:43:11.825 --> 00:43:15.025
Our innovation department
is developing a serum.

00:43:16.225 --> 00:43:19.225
It's kind of like an anti-aging serum,

00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:22.065
but it will be used exclusively
for medical use,

00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:24.665
only for patients with certain conditions.

00:43:24.745 --> 00:43:25.665
Oh.

00:43:27.265 --> 00:43:28.505
But here's the thing.

00:43:31.865 --> 00:43:33.705
This needs to be confidential.

00:43:34.265 --> 00:43:36.745
This can't be disclosed to anyone.

00:43:36.825 --> 00:43:40.185
That's why I need volunteers
who can maintain confidentiality.

00:43:40.945 --> 00:43:42.705
-Yeah.
-Do you understand that?

00:43:43.865 --> 00:43:44.865
Yes.

00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:50.385
Wait, Jit, are you going to sign now?

00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:51.905
Of course, why not?

00:43:54.745 --> 00:43:56.585
Maybe you need time to think it over.

00:43:57.465 --> 00:44:00.025
Isn't it similar to COVID?

00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:02.305
That's true…

00:44:02.985 --> 00:44:07.025
but this time you can't tell anyone.

00:44:07.385 --> 00:44:10.025
And if something happens to you,
you can't see a doctor.

00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:12.425
You have to get
treatment from our department.

00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:16.545
Yeah, let's do it, Professor.

00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:19.705
You trusted me.

00:44:20.545 --> 00:44:25.865
That's even better! I can help others.

00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:28.465
Our bodies aren't really ours anyway.

00:44:29.025 --> 00:44:30.585
At this age,

00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:33.185
there's nothing to be afraid anymore.

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:35.705
Great!

00:44:35.785 --> 00:44:37.825
If I can help others, I will.

00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:41.105
I forgot to tell you
that the program provides compensation.

00:44:41.185 --> 00:44:45.265
I noticed that you've got some financial
problems, so I thought this might help.

00:44:45.825 --> 00:44:46.905
Is that so?

00:44:46.985 --> 00:44:49.225
Is it a lot of money? Up to 1,000 baht?

00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:51.225
Ten thousand.

00:44:52.465 --> 00:44:53.545
Wow.

00:44:54.145 --> 00:44:55.305
That's a lot.

00:44:56.585 --> 00:44:58.305
Thank you, Professor.

00:44:58.785 --> 00:45:00.985
Can you fill in the form
with rough details?

00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:17.345
What was it?

00:45:19.025 --> 00:45:21.105
Ah! Okay. I'll go check it out.

00:45:31.545 --> 00:45:33.025
Is this the right one?

00:45:33.625 --> 00:45:34.585
Yep, found it.

00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.145
Jean?

00:45:41.385 --> 00:45:43.345
The building is closed. Why are you here?

00:45:44.905 --> 00:45:46.305
I left my stuff here.

00:45:46.825 --> 00:45:48.865
-I left my card with Nui--
-Leave now.

00:45:53.225 --> 00:45:55.225
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

00:46:06.225 --> 00:46:07.105
Jean!

00:46:07.185 --> 00:46:08.025
Jean!

00:46:08.105 --> 00:46:08.985
Jean!

00:46:10.265 --> 00:46:11.145
Huh?

00:46:11.545 --> 00:46:12.985
Why don't you answer me?

00:46:18.265 --> 00:46:19.905
I'm thinking about Pao.

00:47:23.185 --> 00:47:24.185
Pao?

00:47:31.905 --> 00:47:32.905
Pao.

00:47:36.385 --> 00:47:37.625
Let me hold your bag.

00:47:39.905 --> 00:47:41.345
No, I can hold it myself.

00:47:41.905 --> 00:47:43.345
Give it! We might need to run.

00:47:44.025 --> 00:47:46.465
Can you stop treating me
like I'm not capable?

00:47:46.545 --> 00:47:47.945
I said give it to me!

00:47:48.945 --> 00:47:50.065
Fuck!

00:47:50.145 --> 00:47:53.385
If he wants to hold it, let him!
This is not the time to argue!

00:48:01.185 --> 00:48:02.545
They're all inside now.

00:48:03.145 --> 00:48:04.505
Listen to me carefully.

00:48:05.425 --> 00:48:07.105
This is not a tough mission.

00:48:07.865 --> 00:48:10.985
But if you miss it, we're all screwed.

00:48:11.545 --> 00:48:14.865
So from now on,
you have to follow my orders.

00:48:15.345 --> 00:48:16.585
Mine alone.

00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:18.945
Got it?

00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:20.625
Yeah.

00:48:25.305 --> 00:48:27.065
We'll wait for them to get inside.

00:48:27.145 --> 00:48:29.425
Follow me. Quietly.

00:48:48.145 --> 00:48:50.425
My phone battery won't last much longer.

00:48:50.705 --> 00:48:51.865
It's about to die.

00:48:53.425 --> 00:48:55.025
You don't need to say anything.

00:48:56.825 --> 00:49:00.265
I'll stay here and keep you company
if you don't mind.

00:49:07.985 --> 00:49:09.705
Did you sneak over to see me?

00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:12.505
I…

00:49:13.505 --> 00:49:14.745
wouldn't say so.

00:49:15.985 --> 00:49:17.665
No one's telling me not to.

00:49:18.905 --> 00:49:21.185
Then why are you the first one to see me?

00:49:21.945 --> 00:49:24.745
Others are following
the zombies into the main auditorium.

00:49:25.465 --> 00:49:26.465
Jean, too?

00:49:27.985 --> 00:49:29.065
Yeah.

00:49:30.545 --> 00:49:32.905
Jean told me to come see you first.

00:49:32.985 --> 00:49:34.345
He'll be here later.

00:49:40.265 --> 00:49:41.385
You're lying.

00:49:49.425 --> 00:49:51.265
How do you think this will end?

00:49:56.745 --> 00:49:57.745
I have no idea.

00:49:58.505 --> 00:49:59.665
What I know is,

00:49:59.985 --> 00:50:02.505
I need to survive this
and get out to see my parents.

00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:10.585
None of us understand, Mook.

00:50:11.865 --> 00:50:14.265
We don't need to survive this.

00:50:16.345 --> 00:50:18.465
Nobody died, not a single person.

00:50:19.665 --> 00:50:20.705
What do you mean?

00:50:21.705 --> 00:50:22.665
I don't get it.

00:50:23.185 --> 00:50:24.545
Did you see Fah?

00:50:26.145 --> 00:50:28.105
Didn't you see that she walked toward me?

00:50:28.185 --> 00:50:32.185
Pao, but Fah's already dead,
and the way she walked--

00:50:32.265 --> 00:50:34.705
Mook, no one died.

00:50:34.785 --> 00:50:36.985
They've just become someone we don't know.

00:50:37.665 --> 00:50:38.625
Think about it.

00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:40.465
They're still together.

00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:42.825
They still hunt together.

00:50:43.865 --> 00:50:46.385
They still help
each other unconditionally.

00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:49.825
Pao…

00:50:49.905 --> 00:50:51.425
We're the cruel ones.

00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:54.145
We've watched too many movies.

00:50:54.225 --> 00:50:55.705
And we're so stupid.

00:50:57.305 --> 00:51:00.985
Too stupid to realize
that this is our inevitable destiny.

00:51:02.425 --> 00:51:03.985
We killed them.

00:51:04.545 --> 00:51:06.025
We are the one who killed them.

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:11.985
All they wanted was for us
to become just like them.

00:51:14.865 --> 00:51:16.305
Come with me, Mook.

00:51:16.985 --> 00:51:18.185
Where to?

00:51:19.225 --> 00:51:20.985
To the new life.

00:51:21.665 --> 00:51:23.105
We'll go to them…

00:51:23.945 --> 00:51:25.825
and let things take their course.

00:51:27.505 --> 00:51:29.745
-Pao…
-I will hold your hand like this,

00:51:29.825 --> 00:51:32.905
and when you wake up, you'll still see me.

00:51:35.385 --> 00:51:39.065
-Let's go, come with me.
-No, Pao. Stop.

00:51:39.145 --> 00:51:40.745
Pao, stop. Claim down, Pao.

00:51:41.825 --> 00:51:43.905
Pao, listen to me. Get a grip first.

00:51:46.465 --> 00:51:47.905
Nothing about this is normal.

00:51:49.225 --> 00:51:51.345
Pao, we shouldn't be going through this.

00:51:51.425 --> 00:51:54.625
We should be living
the life we're meant to live.

00:51:55.025 --> 00:51:56.385
We should go back to school,

00:51:56.945 --> 00:51:59.745
go to malls, eat delicious food.

00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:01.425
We should see our parents again.

00:52:01.505 --> 00:52:04.665
We should have children,
to repay the love we received…

00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:07.905
and then wait for them
to repay us in turn.

00:52:10.585 --> 00:52:12.305
I don't want to argue about this.

00:52:12.665 --> 00:52:16.465
But you can choose the kind of life
you want to live.

00:52:16.825 --> 00:52:18.145
But not like this, Pao.

00:52:19.065 --> 00:52:20.305
Not like this.

00:52:21.265 --> 00:52:22.705
This is suicide!

00:52:22.785 --> 00:52:25.465
No one died! I said no one died!

00:52:25.545 --> 00:52:27.225
Stop talking about death!

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.465
No one died. Don't you get it?

00:52:51.105 --> 00:52:52.065
Pao.

00:52:52.865 --> 00:52:53.985
Pao.

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:57.025
Pao, stay with me.

00:52:57.105 --> 00:53:01.585
I really thought that you'd understand.

00:53:01.665 --> 00:53:02.705
Pao.

00:53:04.465 --> 00:53:06.305
Pao, Jean is on his way.

00:53:06.825 --> 00:53:08.265
Stay with me, please.

00:53:09.905 --> 00:53:11.425
Listen to me, Pao.

00:54:09.265 --> 00:54:10.945
Sun is out of his fucking mind.

00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:13.465
Hey, calm down.

00:54:13.545 --> 00:54:16.185
-At least we have a refuge.
-What refuge?

00:54:16.265 --> 00:54:18.985
-What if she wakes up and eats us?
-Keep your voice down.

00:54:22.345 --> 00:54:23.225
Game…

00:54:24.025 --> 00:54:25.305
your brother's in there.

00:54:26.025 --> 00:54:28.185
If we stay with them, we'll survive.

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:30.385
-It's impossible for all of us to go.
-No.

00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:31.985
Just the two of us.

00:54:32.425 --> 00:54:33.465
Just you and me.

00:54:36.265 --> 00:54:39.065
But our kids are here.
We can't leave them.

00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:42.545
And on the way to Jean,
the zombies would get us first.

00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:44.545
What about the one in there with us?

00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:47.545
Isn't that a zombie?
Is that a squid to you?

00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:48.465
I don't know.

00:54:48.545 --> 00:54:49.745
What are you doing here?

00:55:05.625 --> 00:55:07.225
I guess she really got infected.

00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:13.225
Is there anything you can do, doc?

00:55:14.065 --> 00:55:16.305
I'm a first-year med student,
I'm still a kid.

00:55:16.825 --> 00:55:18.345
What do you want from me?

00:55:19.505 --> 00:55:20.905
I'm the one who killed her.

00:55:30.665 --> 00:55:32.105
You knew she couldn't swim?

00:55:32.545 --> 00:55:35.905
I didn't know what to do at that time,
and the pool was in front of me.

00:55:37.825 --> 00:55:39.265
Look at the bright side.

00:55:40.865 --> 00:55:42.465
You're lucky that you're friends.

00:55:42.545 --> 00:55:45.825
If it weren't for you,
they might have had no idea how to escape.

00:55:48.185 --> 00:55:49.985
Thank you for growing so well.

00:55:50.745 --> 00:55:51.785
I'm so sorry.

00:55:51.865 --> 00:55:53.705
I really need to use your leaves.

00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:00.385
Dumb cane,

00:56:00.785 --> 00:56:01.745
nettles,

00:56:02.305 --> 00:56:03.345
castor bean,

00:56:05.145 --> 00:56:06.105
psilocybe mushroom.

00:56:06.785 --> 00:56:08.705
Psilocybe mushroom!

00:56:12.745 --> 00:56:14.745
What will you do with mushrooms and herbs?

00:56:15.385 --> 00:56:18.665
Magic mushrooms contain psilocybin…

00:56:19.345 --> 00:56:21.265
which can cause strong hallucinations.

00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:22.665
And then there's LSD, too.

00:56:24.065 --> 00:56:26.665
Oh! Magic mushroom.

00:56:26.745 --> 00:56:27.785
That's correct!

00:56:27.865 --> 00:56:29.545
There's actually a study

00:56:29.625 --> 00:56:31.785
where they used
this substance from mushrooms

00:56:31.865 --> 00:56:33.585
on people with depression.

00:56:33.945 --> 00:56:35.585
When they scanned their brains,

00:56:36.105 --> 00:56:41.225
it helped heal the brains
of those with severe depression.

00:56:42.185 --> 00:56:45.345
Back then, before these mushrooms
were made illegal,

00:56:46.025 --> 00:56:48.105
people actually used them for cooking.

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:52.225
In small amounts,
they worked like medicine.

00:56:53.025 --> 00:56:55.745
But if you took more than 19.6 milligrams…

00:56:57.865 --> 00:57:00.225
it could send you
into shock or even kill you.

00:57:03.985 --> 00:57:07.545
So, how many mushrooms
would it take to deal with the zombies?

00:57:08.105 --> 00:57:09.265
We need to try.

00:57:18.425 --> 00:57:19.345
Okay.

00:57:21.265 --> 00:57:22.225
I said okay.

00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:25.345
Qi! Why did you touch it?
You'll catch the infection!

00:57:29.465 --> 00:57:30.625
Lily is still here.

00:57:32.985 --> 00:57:34.465
She is still inside the body.

00:57:39.225 --> 00:57:40.465
What did you just say?

00:57:41.745 --> 00:57:43.865
She told me
that she wants us to leave her.

00:57:44.585 --> 00:57:46.025
What are you talking about?

00:57:46.105 --> 00:57:48.425
You might not believe
in this kind of thing…

00:57:49.745 --> 00:57:52.265
-but Lily really talked to me.
-Wait a second.

00:58:00.905 --> 00:58:02.185
This is impossible.

00:58:02.985 --> 00:58:06.105
-Why would I lie to you, Nokia?
-No, it wasn't about that!

00:58:09.465 --> 00:58:10.545
They've got…

00:58:13.505 --> 00:58:14.665
mesentery!

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.105
-What's that?
-What does it mean?

00:58:18.865 --> 00:58:20.265
It heals itself.

00:58:26.905 --> 00:58:29.905
Lily is already dead.
Why would you bring her body back?

00:58:30.305 --> 00:58:31.265
My little sister.

00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:33.785
-And she is also your sister!
-Just someone older!

00:58:33.865 --> 00:58:36.025
Not my real sister or even Game's sister.

00:58:36.345 --> 00:58:39.665
His real brother is out there,
the real one from the same bloodline.

00:58:39.745 --> 00:58:42.385
Toto, calm down.

00:58:44.785 --> 00:58:47.625
I was right not to choose you two.

00:58:48.065 --> 00:58:50.025
-Choose what?
-Choose to become a mentor.

00:58:50.705 --> 00:58:52.225
Screw it!

00:58:52.305 --> 00:58:55.345
We're dying! Can't you see?
And you're thinking about that?

00:58:57.265 --> 00:59:00.425
If we all die, the cheerleading
dance routine that you know,

00:59:00.505 --> 00:59:01.985
I know, and Lily knows…

00:59:02.865 --> 00:59:06.465
will disappear forever!

00:59:06.545 --> 00:59:09.305
I'm asking you,
is your entire life about this?

00:59:09.385 --> 00:59:12.225
Cheerleading?
Is that all you fucking care about?

00:59:12.305 --> 00:59:13.945
-Go see a doctor!
-So what?

00:59:14.025 --> 00:59:15.905
My life is cheerleaders and you guys!

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.745
That's it!

00:59:19.865 --> 00:59:21.585
That's why I couldn't let anyone go.

00:59:24.905 --> 00:59:25.945
Sun…

00:59:26.505 --> 00:59:29.785
But the one that's with us in there
is a zombie.

00:59:29.865 --> 00:59:31.945
We can do nothing about it.

00:59:35.185 --> 00:59:36.585
There's nothing more to say.

00:59:36.665 --> 00:59:38.665
If being on the same cheerleading team…

00:59:40.585 --> 00:59:42.185
didn't mean anything to you…

00:59:44.025 --> 00:59:45.145
then go ahead.

00:59:47.465 --> 00:59:49.745
It's my fault.
I should have taught you better.

00:59:49.825 --> 00:59:53.105
Stop manipulating me
and then making me feel bad about it!

00:59:53.865 --> 00:59:56.185
No! I really mean it.

00:59:56.865 --> 00:59:57.945
-Leave me!
-Liar.

00:59:58.025 --> 00:59:59.185
-I'm not!
-Ugly bitch!

00:59:59.265 --> 01:00:00.865
-I'm not!
-But your heart is ugly!

01:00:00.945 --> 01:00:02.105
You're ugly, too!

01:00:02.185 --> 01:00:03.385
You never listen to me!

01:00:03.465 --> 01:00:05.665
-Since freshman year, I tried to--
-Damn it!

01:00:10.745 --> 01:00:11.625
What the hell?

01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:13.985
I don't want you to fight!

01:00:15.265 --> 01:00:16.585
You can run from anything,

01:00:16.945 --> 01:00:19.905
but you can't run
from being a cheerleader of Kiat!

01:00:19.985 --> 01:00:23.025
You've been manipulating me
since my first year!

01:00:23.105 --> 01:00:24.905
Come on, stop it, please!

01:00:27.585 --> 01:00:28.745
What is that?

01:00:31.345 --> 01:00:32.545
That's a gunshot.

01:00:38.785 --> 01:00:39.985
Damn it!

01:00:44.105 --> 01:00:45.065
Damn!

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:46.105
Shit!
