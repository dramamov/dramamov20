Give it your all, Vee. This project,

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.900
We definitely have to beat Jinta’s team.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.166
Khun Chan, Khun Pad’s calling for a meeting.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.833
Damn it, meetings all day.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.666
This is the old man I told you about.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
What a coincidence! Let me have your IG.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.766
- My account’s private.
- Sis!

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.233
I’m really happy to be in Kitakyushu with you.

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.500
I like Kitakyushu too.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.033
Especially when you’re here with me.

00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.733
You’re not setting private anymore?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.566
Nope, not anymore.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700
What make you change your mind?

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.700
You wouldn’t even let me follow you before.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700
Well, now you can. Isn’t that good?

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:53.966
It’s good.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.566
I love it.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.066
Pick up, sis.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.333
Hello, Khun Mind.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:24.933
May I ask what business you have WITH MY P’Aokbab?

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:41.300
Babe, tell her we’re on our honeymoon.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.866
If there’s nothing else, we’ll hang up now.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.500
We’ve got more romantic time to spend.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.033
Sayonara, Khun Mind-san!

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:59.033
Bleh!

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:02.666
What on earth are you doing?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.766
Talking to Mind-san, what else?

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:06.900
Ugh.

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.800
Ugh, it’s so cold, sis.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.266
Let me hug you.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.233
My hands are freezing.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.100
Hey, let go!

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.400
But it’s cold!

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.266
Come on, just a little.

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:33.566
Fine, fine—come here, it’s cold anyway.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.366
Yahh—

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.200
You okay?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.400
I’m not drunk.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:06.066
See? I still walk straight.

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:18.633
Such a romantic night, isn’t it?

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:20.233
Yeah.

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:24.966
Do you think—

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.066
we should kiss again?

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.266
What—hey!

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.300
Khun Ming wouldn’t do that.

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:35.733
We’re walking on the street, have some shame.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.633
Why be shy? The more people see, the better.

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:42.333
Let everyone see how much we love each other.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.533
Stop right there, you little puppy.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.100
I’m not a puppy, I’m a little kitty—meow.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.700
Haven’t you had enough?

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:54.400
Think of it as payment.

00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:56.966
For saving you from that old hag earlier.

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:58.666
You call that saving me?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.100
I knew you didn’t want to talk to her.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.300
Yeah?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.166
Still, don’t you think that was too much?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.166
I was just doing my duty.

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:08.333
What duty?

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.766
Protecting the one I love.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.966
You’re really in character, Khun Ming.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.700
I’m serious though.

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:29.533
I’m actually flirting with you.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.566
Hm?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.366
Isn’t that enough already?

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:41.166
That kiss was just roleplay.

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:42.866
But now—

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:45.033
I want a real one.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.466
Hey—

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:50.166
We’ve got to pack tonight.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.466
We’re flying back tomorrow.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.466
- No! You’re not going anywhere! Come here!
- Hey—!

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.333
- Rin, let go!
- hehe!

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:58.066
Rin, the beer’s gonna spill!

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.500
What are you doing, you crazy pup—Rin!

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:05.100
It’s spilling—stop, stop! That’s enough!

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:12.100
What are you doing?!

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.800
Rin!

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.733
Ugh, people are watching!

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:39.333

I’m here!

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.333
Breakfast’s ready.

00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:31.100
Look, I brought you some souvenirs!

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.133
- Ooh, you got sweets?
- And this one!

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:36.100
And this— a special gift just for you, P’Prim.

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:39.833
- Custom-made from Kitakyushu!
- Aww!

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:41.566
One of a kind—made by me.

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:43.400
That’s so cute!

00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:45.466
Oh!

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.733
How is it?

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.433
Thank you!

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:52.400
You're so adorable.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.933
So, how was—

00:07:53.933 --> 00:07:56.933
your Japan trip? Fun?

00:07:56.933 --> 00:07:58.133
So much fun!

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.266
I got to do a lot of research too.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.066
The weather was perfect, and the food—amazing.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.833
- Sounds dreamy!
- I wanna go too.

00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:08.300
But still—nothing beats Thai basil stir-fry!

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.500
True that, I’ve never even been there!

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.133
So…

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:16.133
How are things with Khun Aokbab? Getting along better?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.800
Well—

00:08:21.966 --> 00:08:23.600
It’s good. Everything’s smooth.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.066
Hmm.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.066
Ever since you started working with her—

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:30.033
you’ve really changed, you know?

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.833
Changed? I’m the same as always.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.500
Maybe, but—

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.000
I can see you’re a lot happier.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.233
And more thoughtful about others, too.

00:08:40.233 --> 00:08:41.733
You’re exaggerating.

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:45.166
You’ve never bought me a gift before, have you?

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:48.200
See?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.133
Really? Never?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.000
Nope, never.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.800
Totally surprised—but hey,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.800
thank you.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.366
Uh—

00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:00.033
Can I ask you something?

00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:01.266
- About what?
- Hmm...

00:09:03.466 --> 00:09:05.600
- Let’s say, hypothetically, hypothetically!—
- Okay.

00:09:05.766 --> 00:09:08.800
If I like someone,

00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:12.733
but I don’t know if they feel the same,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.700
is there a way to tell what they think?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.400
Well…

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.400
It’s simple.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.600
If you care about them,

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:31.600
and they care about you too—

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:35.966
that means—

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.233
wow.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.266
That’s it?

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:45.700
Yep.

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:15.833
Here!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.333
Here it goes!

00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:20.300
Eat up.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.066
Hey, I think I’ll use some gimmicks—

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:29.400
inspired by the places Khun Rain and Khun Ming visited—

00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:31.866
and blend them into the design.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.400
I want that feeling to stay in their home when they’re together.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.266
What do you think?

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.400
- I like it.
- Sounds good. What else did you bring back from the trip?

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:42.666
I feel like…

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:46.400
I need to pay more attention to what’s around me.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.666
All this time,

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:51.900
I think I’ve overlooked something important.

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:54.866
The heart was right in front of me, but I couldn’t see it.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.200
Are you talking about work—

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.800
or something else?

00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:10.933
Work, obviously. What else would I mean?

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:16.433
Ever since you came back from Japan—

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.133
you’ve seemed different.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.100
Hm.

00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:21.633
You never talk about work during meals.

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:22.566
True.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.933
Yeah!

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:26.000
if we wait till after, we’ll starve.

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.733
- So are you and Rin still going to stay at Khun Rain’s house?
- Yeah.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.633
Probably for a little longer.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:36.966
Until the design feels just right.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.166
And that’s the only reason you’re staying? Work?

00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.066
Or is there… something else?

00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:58.266
Oh crap.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.933
Khun Rain’s throwing a birthday party for Khun Ming.

00:12:00.933 --> 00:12:02.266
He invited us. You coming?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.500
Uh… not really my thing. You guys go ahead.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.400
Where should we meet tomorrow, Sis?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.100
[Sighs]

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.933
Chan! Chan!

00:12:30.966 --> 00:12:33.466
- Huh?
- Hmm, the pork’s kinda sweet today, right?

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.000
Sweet pork? What?

00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:38.733
Hey, we picked that out precisely, okay?

00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:39.700
It’s food wasted, you know.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.266
- Yeah...yeah.
- Even the mushrooms taste sweet.

00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:48.033
- Hey, stop it!
- It’s pork tongue. We should stop teasing her, man. Let stop teasing her!

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.900
Did you get home yet, Sis?

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.166
I’ve finished packing.

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:13.033
I’m so excited.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.333
Good night.

00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:25.100
I think I need to start paying more attention to the things around me.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.466
All this time—

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:29.966
I’ve overlooked something… even though the heart was right in front of me.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.533
But I just couldn’t see it.

00:13:34.033 --> 00:13:35.533
you’ve really changed.

We don’t have much time left at Khun Rain’s house.

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:00.866
We’d better hurry up and finish the project.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.266
And if we can’t finish in time?

00:15:07.266 --> 00:15:09.566
Where should we continue?

00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:12.800
- Your place?
- My place.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.966
Okay, and...

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.500
what if it gets late?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.666
- Sleep in your...
- You can sleep in my room.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.600
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

00:15:35.733 --> 00:15:36.900
Are you okay?

00:15:41.866 --> 00:15:44.100
Your hand…

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.700
Ah…

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.766
Sorry—

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:53.400
I didn’t mean to!

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:58.533
It’s okay.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.566
I’m totally fine.

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:02.166
Fine about what?

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.400
Just… fine with everything.

00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:17.700
Really. Don’t worry.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:22.500
Okay?

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.600
Yeah.

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:44.133
What are you doing?

00:17:00.366 --> 00:17:01.633
Isn’t that Khun Rain’s house?

00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:02.666
Yeah.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.400
What do you think if I stay at the office for a while?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.366
Why would you do that?

00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:24.933
I don’t think I can work properly.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.400
I’m uneasy about this Khun Rain project.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.100
You know our companies are rivals.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.233
You don’t trust me, do you?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.233
It’s not that—I just feel…

00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:36.500
If we had our own house—

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:38.900
we’d each have our own workspace.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.866
And we wouldn’t have to keep doubting each other like this.

00:17:42.566 --> 00:17:43.866
But we don’t, Tis.

00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:02.800
I’m sorry.

00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:18.766
Please don’t be mad at me.

00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:01.500
Still mad at me?

00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:04.466
I’m not anymore.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.733
What are you doing?

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.000
Hold still—don’t move or you’ll mess it up.

00:19:24.433 --> 00:19:25.366
There, looks good.

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.633
I’m heading out.

00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:33.800
Drive safely, and—

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.666
don’t stress too much about the house.

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:37.400
Okay.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.166
Go on, get to work.

00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:41.400
Love you.

00:19:49.866 --> 00:19:51.066
Bye-bye.

00:20:07.733 --> 00:20:09.866
Ugh, call center again—so persistent.

00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:12.766
Hello?

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.700
You scammers who feeding off people’s misery.

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:17.133
You’re Khun Pad’s secretary, right, Khun Tertis?

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:19.466
Wow, you even know my job title now?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.333
Of course. We’ve met quite a few times already.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.866
Who is this?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.700
This is Thee from Mind Space.

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.533
I just wanted to invite you out for lunch.

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:39.966
I have a proposal I’d like to discuss.

00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:42.933
It might just help you and Khun Vee—

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:45.366
afford the house of your dreams.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.666
Coffee’s here, my love.

00:21:09.666 --> 00:21:10.833
Careful, it’s hot.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.666
Thanks.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700
Hey, sis—

00:21:22.966 --> 00:21:25.233
I’ve been thinking about Khun Rain’s house.

00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:28.533
What if we use Japanese home-building techniques?

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.900
And for the interior, add some Kitakyushu vibes.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.333
I think Khun Rain and Khun Ming would love it.

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.466
I was thinking the same thing.

00:21:39.266 --> 00:21:40.133
Really?

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:42.033
We are in sync, right?

00:22:11.666 --> 00:22:12.733
What are you looking at?

00:22:16.733 --> 00:22:18.433
Nothing. I wasn’t looking.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.733
You feeling okay?

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:23.000
- You’ve got a fever? Let me check—
- Eh—

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.366
Eh— no, I’m fine.

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:28.533
It’s just the weather.

00:22:29.533 --> 00:22:30.933
You look flushed though.

00:22:32.266 --> 00:22:33.300
It’s hot!

00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:40.633
Hmm.

00:22:40.733 --> 00:22:41.700
Hey, sis—

00:22:42.033 --> 00:22:44.133
We’ve been to Japan together for days.

00:22:44.233 --> 00:22:45.366
So,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.033
We’re pretty close already, right?

00:22:49.066 --> 00:22:50.066
I guess so.

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:53.466
So, um—

00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:57.433
the guest room ceiling is leaking.

00:22:57.866 --> 00:22:59.500
Still not fixed.

00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:02.033
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.700
The guest room

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.266
It’s leaking,

00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:12.100
Uh-huh.

00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:19.533
And when we sleep—

00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:21.366
can I cuddle you?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.366
What kind of question is that?

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.566
Are you crazy?

00:23:30.866 --> 00:23:32.100
What? You’re so silly.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.233
Where are you going? That’s mine!

00:23:35.633 --> 00:23:36.500
Sorry!

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.866
You didn’t say no, so I’ll take that as a yes.

00:23:55.866 --> 00:23:57.466
- Hello.
- Hi there.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:59.166
Oh, thank you.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.166
Hello.

00:24:00.366 --> 00:24:01.566
Please, make yourself comfortable.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.033
Hello, Khun Ming. Happy birthday.

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:05.366
Thank you so much.

00:24:05.433 --> 00:24:06.333
Thanks again.

00:24:06.366 --> 00:24:07.433
That’s so sweet of you.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.866
Hello, Khun Rain, Khun Ming.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.833
Hi there.

00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:10.933
Happy birthday.

00:24:11.433 --> 00:24:13.166
I carefully picked this birthday gift—

00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:14.533
especially for you, Khun Ming.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.800
Thank you, that’s so lovely.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.200
About the house renovation design—

00:24:19.233 --> 00:24:21.900
Is there any particular feature you’d like?

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.133
Or any details you’d like us to finalize, please let us know.

00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:26.500
- Sure.
- Of course.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.400
You really take good care of the clients, don’t you, Khun Thee?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.533
Hello there.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.066
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:36.966
Oh, you both came too, Khun Chan, Khun Pad?

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.566
Of course, we had to be here.

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:40.900
Why wouldn’t we?

00:24:53.833 --> 00:24:55.200
Hey, guys! Check this out —

00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:56.900
I’ve got something to show you!

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.700
What is it?

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.700
Whoa.

00:24:58.766 --> 00:25:01.566
- It’s our company sign!
- Whoa!

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:02.900
Damn, that looks great.

00:25:03.433 --> 00:25:05.933
Sammitr Co. (Three Brotherhood Co.) is gonna be huge, I’m telling you.

00:25:05.966 --> 00:25:08.666
- Yeah.
- We’ll make it together. Our future’s bright.

00:25:08.666 --> 00:25:10.666
Here, grab your glasses! Hold them up!

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.733
Let’s drink to this — we’ll never betray or abandon each other.

00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:19.966
- I’m counting on you, seniors!
- Cheers!

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.600
What the hell did you do, Thee?!

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.766
- How could you make a deal behind our backs?!
- Why didn’t you tell us first?!

00:25:26.266 --> 00:25:28.766
I already talked to the client! What was I supposed to do?

00:25:28.966 --> 00:25:31.866
You know damn well that budget isn’t enough to finish the project.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.700
I’ve already taken it.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.233
You just have to make it work.

00:25:35.566 --> 00:25:37.466
How can you be so damn irresponsible?

00:25:39.866 --> 00:25:41.400
You’re always bragging about—

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.300
How good you are

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.166
prove it like you said!

00:25:44.566 --> 00:25:46.533
What the hell are you saying, man?!

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.900
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:25:49.066 --> 00:25:50.966
If you’re gonna keep deciding everything on your own,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.166
We’re done. We quit.

00:25:52.266 --> 00:25:53.866
Hey, you can’t just walk away like that!

00:25:53.966 --> 00:25:55.533
- I already accepted the job!
- Enough!

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.000
What a stupid decision, man.

00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:58.266
- I don’t want to work with you anymore.
- Where are you going?!

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.600
I’m out. Let go of me.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.000
I already accepted... Fuck whatever!

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.733
Go ahead, just leave!

00:26:05.833 --> 00:26:07.433
Just leave! All of you!

00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:10.566
Fine! I’ll do it myself! Don’t come crawling back!

00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:35.966
I told you, didn’t I?

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.566
It was never going to work.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.366
No wonder they dropped the deal.

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.366
If you came here just to talk shit,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.600
then get lost.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.433
You’ve got some nerve, huh?

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.900
We quit—

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.733
and now you still took our project to finish it yourself.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.200
What did you expect me to do?!

00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:54.700
The company was falling apart after you left!

00:26:54.933 --> 00:26:57.233
I did everything I could to keep it alive!

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.400
Tell me—

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600
where was I wrong?!

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:03.000
- You bastard!
- Chan!

00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:06.200
You hit my brother, huh?!

00:27:07.233 --> 00:27:08.033
- Shit—

00:27:08.533 --> 00:27:10.733
- Chan! What the hell are you doing?!

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.800
- You want some?!

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.333
- Stop it! Enough!

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.200
You wanna hit me, you asshole?!

00:27:28.233 --> 00:27:30.566
- You—
- Shit!

00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:33.566
- Chan, that’s enough! I said stop, Chan!

00:27:34.466 --> 00:27:36.033
- Stop! Stop!

00:27:36.033 --> 00:27:39.000
- You think you’re tough, huh?!
- Damn it!

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.566
- Stop! Both of you!

00:27:44.633 --> 00:27:46.133
I said stop!

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:49.166
- You—
- That’s enough!

00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:55.933
Stop it, both of you!

00:28:06.133 --> 00:28:07.500
Have you been here long?

00:28:08.866 --> 00:28:10.300
We just got here, actually.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.766
Perfect timing, too.

00:28:12.366 --> 00:28:13.866
Oh—here, this is for you, Khun Ming.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.566
- Thank you.
- Wishing you lots of happiness.

00:28:15.966 --> 00:28:18.100
Just having you here makes me happy already. Thank you so much.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.466
- It’s my pleasure.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.566
The dessert’s here!

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.900
Thanks.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.100
[Sigh]

00:28:40.466 --> 00:28:41.733
it’s just work.

00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:44.600
Kidding.

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.766
If you’re gonna bring up what happened earlier,

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.800
I’m not answering.

00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:03.833
P'Prim said I should get the HPV vaccine—

00:29:03.966 --> 00:29:05.433
Cervical cancer prevention.

00:29:05.933 --> 00:29:07.866
Come with me, please? I’m scared of needles.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.133
Or… we could go together!

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.900
Eh—no way, I’m not going.

00:29:12.933 --> 00:29:14.966
Are you trying to jinx me or what?

00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:16.533
I’m not!

00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:19.533
I’m just worried about you.
I want us to stay together for a long time.

00:29:22.566 --> 00:29:23.500
So…

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.866
about that cuddling—

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:28.833
Answer, hurry!

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.633
No answer means permission granted,

00:29:35.933 --> 00:29:36.866
Okay

00:29:45.466 --> 00:29:46.966
Hold on, I’ve got to take this call.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.766
Hey, Stop calling me.

00:30:02.966 --> 00:30:05.300
We’re not in a position to be talking like this.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.733
You’re not coming to the party?

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.400
Didn’t you get what I said?

00:30:11.866 --> 00:30:13.033
Stop calling me.

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.233
Why can’t I call you?

00:30:20.566 --> 00:30:22.400
We haven’t even broken up yet.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.466
I still want to talk to you.

00:30:55.233 --> 00:30:57.600
I’m looking forward to seeing your work.

00:30:57.633 --> 00:30:59.933
You all seem very dedicated.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.966
Yes, especially since Khun Rin and Khun Aokbab

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.333
even moved into the house themselves.

00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:07.666
I’m excited and can’t wait to see the design.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.566
Yes.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.533
How long have they been there?

00:31:13.566 --> 00:31:15.166
For a little while now.

00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:17.066
Please, make yourselves at home.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.533
Hello. Thank you so much for coming.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.500
When do we have to pay them?

00:31:45.733 --> 00:31:47.100
I’ll take care of it right away.

00:31:47.433 --> 00:31:49.033
Okay.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.333
What’s up? Something wrong?

00:32:10.066 --> 00:32:11.033
What’s the matter, hmm?

00:32:13.733 --> 00:32:15.400
You know you can always talk to me, right?

00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:21.166
I…

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.666
It’s just…

00:32:32.766 --> 00:32:34.533
We shouldn’t keep secrets from each other.

00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:38.666
I have a proposal for you.

00:32:39.033 --> 00:32:40.800
It might let you and Vee—

00:32:41.066 --> 00:32:42.833
Finally buy your dream home.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.600
What is it?

00:33:05.633 --> 00:33:06.533
Are you okay?

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.433
Nothing.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.766
Can you make me some porridge? I’m hungry.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.033
Now?

00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:19.100
Please… make it for me.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.833
This house has so many little corners.

00:33:27.833 --> 00:33:30.633
It makes cleaning really difficult.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.566
Even with housekeepers, I doubt they can get every spot.

00:33:35.233 --> 00:33:36.066
This one—

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200
The kitchen.

00:33:37.466 --> 00:33:38.466
I think...

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.033
We should have a center island like this.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.666
Move the range hood to the center.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.133
So when they cook—

00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:49.533
Khun Ming can reach everything easily.

00:33:50.266 --> 00:33:51.166
Like this.

00:33:53.766 --> 00:33:54.866
What do you think?

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.266
Mmm, that’s nice.

00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:08.366
When they’re cooking together—

00:34:08.666 --> 00:34:10.700
They can do it like this too.

00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:52.000
What are you doing here?

00:34:55.166 --> 00:34:56.300
I’m going to stay here.

00:34:59.033 --> 00:34:59.833
No way.

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:02.400
You’re not welcome here.

00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:05.266
If you have the right to stay in this house—

00:35:05.466 --> 00:35:06.666
then so do I.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.300
I already asked Khun Rain for permission.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.733
This house has quite a few damaged areas, doesn’t it?

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:22.100
Just from the outside, I can already see leaks and water damage.

00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:24.666
I bet there are more inside.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400
Have you checked them yet?

00:35:32.266 --> 00:35:33.133
Already did.

00:35:33.333 --> 00:35:35.833
Every bedroom’s leaking right now.

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.966
There’s no room left for anyone else.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Then I’ll just sleep with Aokbab.

00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:43.066
We used to share a room all the time when we traveled together.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.200
Unfortunately, P'Aokbab’s room isn’t available right now.

00:35:48.266 --> 00:35:49.833
Because I’m sleeping next to her.

00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:51.466
We even cuddle when we sleep.

00:35:54.966 --> 00:35:57.866
I think once you’ve finished your inspection, you should head back.

00:35:58.233 --> 00:35:59.833
I’m staying overnight.

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:01.766
I can sleep on the sofa.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.800
Fine, do whatever you want.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.333
Aokbab—

00:36:07.533 --> 00:36:09.500
Show me around the house.

00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.233
I’ll take you.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.100
I’ll show you every single corner.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.733
How’s that sound, Auntie Mind?

00:36:21.233 --> 00:36:21.766
Let’s go.

00:36:31.966 --> 00:36:33.333
After you, Auntie.

00:37:01.066 --> 00:37:03.466
I know what you're trying to do.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.733
But let me tell you—it’s not going to work.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.666
I’m just here to work.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.633
I want everything to be fair.

00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:13.866
That’s all.

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.400
Fair?

00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:19.066
You mean, farewell?

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.433
The only thing P'Aokbab still has for you—

00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:27.233
is hatred. Nothing else.

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:28.733
You should know that.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.000
And you think she loves you?

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.866
I know Aokbab very well.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.766
She’s someone who—

00:37:45.966 --> 00:37:48.200
Always knows what she likes and doesn’t like.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.166
If she hesitates—

00:37:50.766 --> 00:37:52.366
it means she doesn’t like you.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.100
No matter how hard you try to care about her—

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.200
she doesn’t like younger people.

00:38:46.966 --> 00:38:48.966
Do you want shrimp, sis? I’ll peel it for you.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.966
Mhm.

00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:01.733
Crab from the same place we used to go to.

00:39:02.033 --> 00:39:03.233
I’ll peel it for you.

00:39:11.566 --> 00:39:13.800
Try it, see if it still tastes the same.

00:39:21.266 --> 00:39:22.200
Sis—

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.800
Have this shrimp instead — I peeled it for you.

00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:27.000
Shrimp’s better anyway.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.566
Aokbab likes crab.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.233
Not always.

00:39:31.366 --> 00:39:34.966
Maybe she doesn’t like the same old things anymore.

00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:36.966
New things might only taste good the first time.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.566
- And how would you know?
- Rin.

00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:41.466
If you’re done eating—

00:39:43.133 --> 00:39:44.333
Go work upstairs first.

00:39:46.766 --> 00:39:48.066
- I’m not done yet.
- Rin.

00:39:50.166 --> 00:39:50.966
Go.

00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:04.866
I’ll peel it for you.

00:40:07.866 --> 00:40:09.966
I’ll ask you straight — what do you want?

00:40:16.433 --> 00:40:18.066
I want things to go back to how they were.

00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:25.066
It’s not the same anymore, P'Mind.

00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:29.366
How could it not be the same?

00:40:31.233 --> 00:40:32.666
We never even broke up.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.700
You still can’t forget her, can you?

00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:36.066
What about me?

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.933
What am I to you?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.833
Just your subordinate?

00:41:52.866 --> 00:41:53.800
Answer me.

00:41:57.133 --> 00:41:57.966
Between us…

00:41:58.166 --> 00:42:00.000
What else could it possibly be?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.866
I have a proposal for you.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.833
A proposal? What kind?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.700
I want you to report every move Jinta makes.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.433
You and Vee want to buy a house, don’t you?

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.500
I can make that happen this year.

00:44:36.766 --> 00:44:37.800
Okay, All of you, come and have some!

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:40.800
Hurry up, it’s your favorite!

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.066
- Don’t worry.
- There’s plenty.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.766
Tertis, come join us for dessert.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.133
Yong’s gonna eat it all.

00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:48.600
Huh?

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.666
It’s okay—

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:50.700
I’m not hungry.

00:44:57.833 --> 00:44:59.500
Don’t you think Tertis is acting strange?

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.066
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

00:45:12.033 --> 00:45:12.966
Yes, P’Thee.

00:45:13.433 --> 00:45:15.233
How’s it going? Got anything yet?

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.733
I’ve only been here one day. Haven’t gotten much so far.

00:45:19.766 --> 00:45:22.100
If there’s nothing, just come back.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.100
No point wasting time.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Uh…

00:45:27.166 --> 00:45:30.333
Let me stay another two days. Then I’ll go back.

00:45:31.766 --> 00:45:33.066
Be honest with me.

00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:35.866
You still love Aokbab, don’t you?

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.666
Don’t let that ruin the job.

00:45:47.633 --> 00:45:48.800
It’s nothing.

00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:50.733
Work is still work.

00:46:45.066 --> 00:46:46.766
Why are you drawing me?

00:46:59.866 --> 00:47:01.066
Well…

00:47:01.233 --> 00:47:04.033
When we used to travel together, I always drew you like this.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Hey.

00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:39.233
P’Mind, are you drawing me?

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.333
Yeah.

00:47:42.566 --> 00:47:44.233
Then I’ll…

00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:46.566
be your model, okay?

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.133
Which pose should I do?

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.733
How about this?

00:48:33.666 --> 00:48:35.333
You really don’t love me anymore?

00:48:47.633 --> 00:48:48.866
Aokbab…

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.300
You really don’t love me anymore?

00:49:57.633 --> 00:49:58.733
- Wait! ///- Hey!

00:49:59.233 --> 00:50:00.633
Don’t take advantage of her!

00:50:06.966 --> 00:50:09.733
I’m not letting the person who took my first kiss—

00:50:10.633 --> 00:50:11.600
—be with someone else!

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.700
You— / Sis—

00:50:14.066 --> 00:50:15.933
I’ve got an idea for Khun Rain’s house!

00:50:16.533 --> 00:50:18.500
We don’t need to stay here anymore.

00:50:19.233 --> 00:50:19.966
Let’s go.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.900
But Aokbab, you know…

00:50:41.033 --> 00:50:42.700
that I still love you, right?

00:51:47.366 --> 00:51:48.633
Vee, I don’t think this is it.

00:51:48.766 --> 00:51:50.666
It’s not what we discussed at all.

00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:53.166
You’re planning to change the team in charge of Khun Rain’s house, right?

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.066
I’m Mind, an architect from Mind Space.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.133
And today’s concept is—

00:52:02.633 --> 00:52:03.933
“Love Life Balance.”

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.966
Hey—this is our design!

00:52:09.066 --> 00:52:10.933
This is the exact same layout as ours!

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.933
- What the hell
- How does she have our blueprint?!

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:29.266
[Music]

00:52:29.266 --> 00:52:35.033
Love — I don’t know when it began, but it’s already here.

00:52:35.066 --> 00:52:39.366
I don’t really understand why… but it had to be you.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.266
I don’t know why — just seeing your smile feels like a beautiful painting.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:51.266
Like colors filling my heart with clarity.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.500
We might not always fit perfectly,

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.800
But still, I just want to stay close to you.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.433
You feel the same way, don’t you?

00:53:02.466 --> 00:53:09.133
Just having you by my side makes everything perfect today.

00:53:09.166 --> 00:53:13.800
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:21.000
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.733
The one I choose today… is you.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:57.000
From not knowing my own heart, I found that you’re the love I’ve been searching for all my life.

00:53:57.033 --> 00:54:03.133
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:08.000
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.966
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.166
The one I choose today is you.

00:54:20.166 --> 00:54:23.466
How should we love each other?

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:28.366
Let’s design it with our hearts.

00:54:28.366 --> 00:54:32.066
Because that’s how we’ll build a life together.

00:54:32.066 --> 00:54:39.900
From now on, every day will be colored with our love.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.966
Just having you by my side makes everything perfect today.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.266
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you (the answer is you).

00:54:51.266 --> 00:54:57.966
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

00:54:57.966 --> 00:55:03.733
The one I choose today is you.

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:09.133
I want you right here beside me.

00:55:09.166 --> 00:55:13.800
Always.
