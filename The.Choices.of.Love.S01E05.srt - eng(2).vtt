00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
(Presents)

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.080
(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.640
We wish you happiness.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.840
What are you doing here?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.080
The day you moved out
and Krit was waiting for you.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720
He saw me,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.480
and the look in his eyes
wasn’t trustworthy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.240
That you lied to her for money?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.880
Do you think she’ll still love you
if she finds out?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480
I'll get going.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960
Krit.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240
Hey.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.000
It won’t be for long, right?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.160
That we have to keep
hiding like this?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.000
Pim’s growing up so fast.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320
Our child should be able to tell
everyone that she has a father.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.320
It breaks my heart.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.440
If I hadn’t mismanaged the company,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.120
you wouldn’t have
to do things like this.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
It's okay, Prae.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.240
Hang in there a little longer.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.280
Once I have the money
to settle everything,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.040
you, our child, and I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.360
will finally get
to start a happy new life.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.960
I love you.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.320
I love you too.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.920
- I have to go.
- Okay.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.440
May.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.440
Why are you sitting in the dark?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.120
I’m just a little stressed out
about work.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000
Are you done with your meeting?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
Yes.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.480
But I told you I’d be home late.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080
I'm sorry

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400
for making you wait so long.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.280
Aoy and Chod.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.320
I’m really not sure how I feel,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.080
but I still choose to believe

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.120
that he has his reasons for lying.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.480
Do you need to go to the office
early tomorrow?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880
If not,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.120
I want to take you somewhere.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.000
There’s something
I need to tell you.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.520
That’s my ex

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.040
and my daughter.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.240
I’ve been meaning to tell you
for a long time,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.640
but I just didn’t know how to start.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.120
Things between us

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.520
ended a long time ago,
but we still see each other

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360
because of our child.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.120
Pim's still young.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.320
She still doesn't understand.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.400
So we have to pretend

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440
we’re still in love.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.280
That’s why we still meet.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.680
Daddy.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.400
- You're here.
- Pim.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.120
How have you been?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.280
Come on, let's go inside.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
Let's go to bed.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.920
You’re up late tonight.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.560
I just saw your text.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.200
So you’re saying May saw me
and knows about my wife?

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.200
Yes, I’ve been
calling and texting you.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.720
But you were busy doing her.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.920
Who knows where May ran off to now?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.360
You need to change your plans
right now.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.800
Break up with your wife,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.680
and get serious with May

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.840
before everything falls apart.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560
May.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.000
May.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.520
After my meeting last night,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.440
my ex texted me saying

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.520
our daughter wanted to see me

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040
and that she missed me.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.480
So I went to see her

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.200
and spent some time with her.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.120
I’m sorry
I never told you about them.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.280
May, please listen to me.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.600
Is there anything else
you’re not telling me?

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.960
Fine.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.000
After my meeting last night,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.160
I played cards with my friends.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.160
I admit I like to gamble,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.840
but I’ve been trying to quit.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.480
I couldn’t say no last night
because all my friends came over.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.480
But I never used your money
to gamble.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.720
I divided your money
into different parts.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.040
One for the bar,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720
and one...

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.800
for my child.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.720
I’m going through so much right now

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.120
because of my old debts.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.600
I’m sorry I never told you
about any of this.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.640
Believe me.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.720
I don’t know if I can believe you.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.320
I know you,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.720
but it feels like
I don’t know you at all.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.320
Can I really believe you?

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.280
Of course you can.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.400
You’re all I have left.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.640
Without you,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.400
I have nothing.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.800
I’ll have to close my bar,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.880
my friends will disappear,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.000
and my ex will run away
with my child.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.520
Please give me another chance.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.880
If you’re still mad about Prae,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.240
I’m telling you I don’t love her.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280
I just made a mistake,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.800
getting her pregnant.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.720
But once I get everything settled,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.320
I’m going to propose to you.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320
May.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200
This is the ring.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.960
The ring I’ll propose to you with.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.280
Please give me another chance.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.120
Please marry me.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.840
I need to be alone.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.600
May.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.440
Pim's still young.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.280
She still doesn't understand.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.200
So we have to pretend

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.400
we're still in love.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.040
That’s why we still meet.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.400
Krit’s not a bad person.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.720
I know what you’re thinking,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.440
but please don’t think badly of him.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.840
I know you’ll never believe me,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.760
but please, May.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120
I’m really suspicious about this.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.320
I don’t want anything bad
to happen to you.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.480
Please believe me.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.000
I truly wish you well.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.640
I don’t have any hidden agenda.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760
I’m just worried about you,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.720
and I always will be.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.480
I want to warn you.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.240
If you plan to invest in this bar,
check everything carefully.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.680
My friend dropped by
with the documents to sign.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.080
The bar contract
we talked about the other day.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.720
The accounting team is waiting
on them, so he stopped by.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.000
Okay, I’ll sign them quickly.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.200
(Power of Attorney)

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.520
I’m glad

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.720
you’re still here.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.240
I haven’t called

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.720
because I wanted to give you
some time alone.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.400
I still believe

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480
that you’ll understand me.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.480
I’ve been thinking it over.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.400
I understand you.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.840
You didn’t mean to lie to me.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.000
You’ve just been under
so much stress,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320
so you didn’t know

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.320
how to tell me.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.640
Under these circumstances,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.920
it’s only right for me
to stay by your side.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.560
Thank you

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.120
for understanding.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.560
Sometimes life is like
a masquerade party, Aoy and Chod.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.280
We never really know

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.480
what someone who acts happy
is hiding underneath.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.640
Like someone who says they love you.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.360
Do they really love you,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.320
or is there deceit
behind their words?

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.720
Boo!

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.080
Krit, you really scared me.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.360
Aren’t you afraid of me?

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160
No.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.000
Come on, let’s take a selfie.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.280
Our bar's first themed party.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.960
- I’ll send it to you right now.
- Okay.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.320
All the guests
are having so much fun.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.280
You did so well.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.960
Our bar’s going to go viral.
We’ll have more people coming in.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.040
Thank you, May.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.040
I couldn’t have done this
without you.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.160
I'm so lucky.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800
Krit.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.560
Let’s talk outside.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520
I'll be right back.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.960
Okay.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.840
What’s the emergency?
You’re really interrupting me.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.480
I just found our new target.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.240
A new widow.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.800
I think she owns a shipping company.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.440
Her business looks
much better than May’s.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.160
But I’m still busy with May.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.800
Let someone else handle that.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.480
I think she’d like someone like you.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.760
Fine, give me some time.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.960
I just cleared things up with May
about Prae.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.880
I don’t want anyone else getting
involved and messing things up.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.080
Fine.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040
In case you change your mind.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.760
I left the new target’s documents
in your office.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560
Let’s go back in.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.520
Plenty of beautiful, rich women
ready to take advantage of.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.600
Cool, let's go.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.920
Sure, please wait. I’ll send
the documents over right away.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320
Okay.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.760
It’s late.
Are you still discussing work?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440
Yes.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.320
Are you tired?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.760
I’m exhausted.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.480
I need a little moral support.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.600
I love it when you act like this.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.680
Stop working
and let’s have some fun.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.920
Hold on, Krit.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.760
I need to work a little longer.
I’ll join you soon.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.320
Okay, hurry up.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.600
Okay.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.360
Who’s the new target?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920
That one?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280
Did you get her number?

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.720
Of course I did.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.640
Wait.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.960
I left my phone in the room.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.320
Give me the keycard.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880
Wait.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.760
Where is it?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
I probably dropped it.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.840
Ask for a new one at reception.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.320
Darn it.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.880
(Basic Information
of Potential Targets)

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.680
(Widow
Asset: 30-50 million baht)

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.920
(Maysa Warakul, Single
Asset: 30-40 million baht)

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.480
I found out that Krit approached me

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.480
because he saw
that I was doing well.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.640
He intentionally got between
Pat and me to manipulate me.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.400
Krit has never loved me,
Aoy and Chod.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.080
What he and his friends did

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.120
was make a woman fall in love,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520
just to use her.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.480
Even Prae,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.880
the woman he had a child with,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.560
was probably a target too.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.440
(Krit)

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360
Wait.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.040
What is it?

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.960
I know the person staying here.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.800
What were you doing inside?

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.520
I came to get something for Krit.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.080
Please excuse me.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080
Hold on.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.040
Let me call him

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.000
just to make sure
you got the right thing.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200
Wait.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.880
I know who you are.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.200
Krit would never let you in there.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.840
I know who you are too.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.920
You know what’s in this room.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.920
You and Krit planned this together
to deceive me.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.360
What do you mean?

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.320
I know everything about you.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.920
You have a child with Krit.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.760
She’s in that room.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.720
Let me be crystal clear.
Don’t you dare mess with my child.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.280
There are things
you don’t know too.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.280
You’re also one of his victims.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.960
He intentionally lied to you.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560
Believe me.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.440
I don’t want you
or your child to get hurt.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.680
He’s planning to dump you
and put all the blame on you.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Let me tell you something.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.440
Krit would never do that.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.280
Because he loves me.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640
Then listen to this.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.160
If you're still mad about Prae,

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.600
I’m telling you I don’t love her.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.240
I just made a mistake,

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.120
getting her pregnant.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.800
But once I get everything settled,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.680
I’m going to propose to you.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.800
You probably wondered
if he ever really loved you.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.080
No, someone like Krit
loves no one but himself.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.720
He made you fall in love with him,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.000
made you do everything he wanted.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.600
Just like he did with me,
and all the other women.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.360
But I won’t let him do this
to anyone else.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560
What are you doing?

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.560
I need your help.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.280
Print the documents I sent to you
via email.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.920
Thank you all
for having fun with us tonight.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.800
We had a great party,
thanks to Sexy May and her team.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.040
She’s here, so please give her
a round of applause.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520
Thank you.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.960
I have something for you.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320
Here you go.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.000
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.240
On a special day like this,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.200
I want to do something special.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.000
It might seem a little strange
to do this at a Halloween party,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.200
but I couldn’t wait
until Valentine’s Day.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.000
When I’m sure about my feelings,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I want to take action right away.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880
May.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.800
I just hope

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.240
you won’t turn me down this time.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720
Marry me.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.600
Krit.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.800
Were you really planning to dump me?

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.920
You plan to marry her.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.640
- What about me and our child?
- Hey.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.000
Who are you? What do you want?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.960
I see. Is this how
you’re going to act?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.600
It's fine if you want to lie to
everyone and say you don’t know me.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.520
But don’t think you’re the only one
who can lie.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.040
This man is a con artist.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.360
He used me,
and he’s using this woman too.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.200
He’s going to swindle your money.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.440
- Hey.
- You're a real jerk.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.880
Who are you? What do you want?

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.480
Do you have any proof?
I can go to the police.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.560
Where's the proof?

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.680
You never loved me.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.760
Do you have any proof?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.600
- What about our child?
- Your documents.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.080
Do you have any proof?

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.400
Here’s the proof.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.120
You made me sign the power
of attorney and used it freely.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.880
You forged Prae's and my signatures
to deceive everyone too.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.720
Here.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.680
- Have a look, guys.
- May.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680
- Go ahead.
- Hear me out.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880
Listen to me, May.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.720
Are you still going to let him
keep lying to you?

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.640
May. Listen to me.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.240
Nop, say something.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.960
Say something! You jerk!

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.360
No.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.880
Listen to me, May.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.200
- Listen to me. I can explain.
- Go ahead, May.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.400
I’ll gather all the evidence
and go to the police.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.200
See you in court.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.360
May.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680
May.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.880
- Krit.
- May.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240
Listen!

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.000
You never loved me,
but how could you lie to our child?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.840
You’re terrible.
How could you do this?

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.440
- I paid for everything. Shut up.
- How could you do this to us?

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.440
You're horrible.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.280
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone mad?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.560
Have you gone mad?

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640
I like you, May.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720
I love you.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.680
Hey.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.920
- Hey.
- Miss.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.160
Hey.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800
Thank you.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600
Hello.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.680
May.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.320
I heard about you from your team.
How are you?

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.440
The owner of this phone
has passed out.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.800
She won’t wake up.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.960
Her head’s bleeding right now.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.600
What? Where is she?

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.680
Can you call an ambulance for her?

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.080
Sure, I’ll do that.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.560
Okay, thank you.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680
May.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.080
May!

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.840
May!

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240
May.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.360
How is my girlfriend, Doctor?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.080
The patient had a stroke.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
How...

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.040
How is she now?

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.880
Luckily, she doesn’t need surgery,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.240
but we need to monitor her closely.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200
Thank you.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520
Pat.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.920
Pat.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200
May.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640
How are you?

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.680
Hold on.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.760
I’ve called the nurse.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.080
Are you all right?

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680
She’s awake.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.320
I’ll get the doctor right away.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.320
It took some time
to regain parts of my memory.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.800
I had to relearn
how to walk and talk

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.720
so I could get back to normal.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.240
I’m lucky to have Pat by my side.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.480
Being sick was a chance
for Pat to come back into my life.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.200
I got better and better,

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.360
and after that,
I lived happily with Pat

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.560
as friends.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.320
Pat also helped me talk
to the lawyer about Krit

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.280
and the creditors Krit borrowed from
using my name.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040
May.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.560
Don't worry.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.440
Everything will be okay.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.560
I'll help you.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.480
And everything went okay,
just like Pat said.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.440
Krit had to pay for everything
he did to me and everyone else.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.920
Pat gave me back my life.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
May.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.160
Have you taken your medicine?

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.800
If you have, then you should
go to bed.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.000
You can’t stay up late
like you used to.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640
I’ve taken it.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.000
You still have this photo?

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.880
Do you still remember it?

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.360
I'm sorry, Pat.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.400
I’m sorry for how I treated you.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.400
I'm really sorry.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160
It's okay.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.520
All the bad things
are behind us now.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760
May.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.200
Can we get back together

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.560
and be in love once again?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.840
Let me take care of you again.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.480
I love you.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.840
Pat.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280
I...

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.800
I'm sorry.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.240
Okay.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080
It's okay.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.600
In the end, no matter how good
he was to me,

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.480
it couldn’t change
how I felt about him.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.640
He did nothing wrong.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.360
He just loved me,

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.560
but I didn’t love him.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.280
Now I understand that using love

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.200
to hold someone back,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.400
no matter the reason,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.400
only causes pain to
the one who loves.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240
I'll help you.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.480
- It's okay, Pat.
- Let me.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200
Thank you.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.840
I'll get going now.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040
May.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.920
I want you to remember.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.640
No matter what happens,

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.880
I’ll always be here for you.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.080
Thank you.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.760
Thank you so much.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920
Good luck.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.200
Some might say I’m stupid
for leaving a man who loves me.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.640
But sometimes, love isn’t about
being smart or stupid.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.600
It’s about being honest
with your feelings,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.760
and being gentle with the other
person’s heart

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
by not hurting them anymore.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.200
Choosing the person you love
isn’t always the right decision.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.200
Sometimes, love driven only by
emotion can lead to disappointment.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.880
May.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
May.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.080
Are you okay?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
May.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.880
I'll be back. May.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.760
I told you

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.000
that I would take care of you.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040
I love you.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.080
Choosing someone who loves you
when you don’t love them

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.320
can also lead to problems and pain.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.840
So choose the person you love,
who loves you back.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.680
So you can move forward together.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.880
I hope you find that person, May.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.000
Choosing between someone you love
and someone who loves you

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.760
isn’t as good as choosing someone
you love, who loves you back.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.520
Are you Fon, the writer?

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.240
I really love your work.
I’ve read all your stories.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.560
Do you know that girl?

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.320
Let me warn you.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.600
She’s got a reputation
for sleeping around.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.640
Don’t tell me
you’ve fallen for her.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.640
I think everyone has their reasons.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.720
Should we meet again?

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.480
What about my place

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.040
or your place?

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.440
Closer.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.560
- Cut.
- Why don't we hug inside?

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.480
Why don't we hug inside?
Why are we hugging here?

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.880
I danced intensely.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.240
I didn't drink.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.520
She asked if I was okay.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.760
Yes.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120
Show the ring.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760
No.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840
It's okay.
