Fox demon.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.459
Your time

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.540
has come.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.180
Assassin! Protect His Majesty!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.539
Liusu!

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.859
She has help.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.699
Kill her!

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.900
Yes, Your Majesty!

Tushan Yue!

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.900
Get out of there!

Liusu!

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.580
Go...

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.540
To protect His Lordship's beloved...

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.980
I've completed my mission.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.540
Liusu.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.140
I will avenge you now!

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.539
(I will use
my last bit of power to kill you.)

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.740
Fret not.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.060
From this day forward,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.100
he will never wake up again.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.700
(But after using my last power, I'll die.)

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.940
(Then, there will be no one left
to save Yaya.)

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.980
(He'll be controlled by the Gu forever
and will never awaken again.)

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.859
Beast!

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.940
I'll kill you!

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.660
I'll kill you!

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.340
Don't even think
about hurting her again.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.539
Yaya...

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.580
Come on.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.940
Let's go home.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.460
(He knows I've been controlling him.)

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140
(Why didn't he kill me?)

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.420
Yaya.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.380
Yue, you're awake!

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.940
I'll help you.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.500
Slowly.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.180
Youyou.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.740
Am I

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.220
back home?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.460
Yes.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.940
My body...

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.259
Shouldn't it...

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.019
Yes.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.139
Yue.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.300
You were dying after using

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.940
your last bit of power.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.940
It was

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.580
Yaya.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.060
Yaya saved you with his inner core.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.340
Yue,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.500
I don't know
what the underworld is like.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.100
I don't know if it's a scary place.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.060
You are kind

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.140
and warm-hearted.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.780
What if you offend those evil spirits

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.300
and they band together to target you?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.086

Yue.

Before returning your inner core,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.380
he dug new graves for the demons he killed.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.780
I think

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.219
it's his way of repenting

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.340
for what he did.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.180
Yaya...

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.180
I never imagined things
would turn out like this.

Yaya will surely watch over you
from the other side.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.700
All of this is because of Xiling Heng.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.260
If not for him,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.500
none of this would have happened.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.660
I will kill Xiling Heng

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.460
and avenge everyone.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.339
What's happening?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.419
Why is it glowing?

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.419
What's going on?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.700
What's happening?

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.700
What is this?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.860
He's resurrected!

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.100
Yaya.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.700
Yue.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.580
I've returned.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.300
Yaya,

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.099
you're alive!

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.219
This is wonderful!

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.700
Reborn from the flame of purgatory!

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.340
He's

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.099
a phoenix!

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.219
What?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.020
I recognize him now.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.899
He's the son of A'Luan,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.500
the guardian phoenix of Mount Yao.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.859
He's A'Luan's child.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.540
No wonder he looked familiar.
But after everything he did to us...

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.500
I'm sorry to everyone.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.740
As the son of a phoenix,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.860
I will take responsibility
for what I did.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.099
He was controlled.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.339
But he's done so much for us now.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.259
I believe in him.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.180
I believe in him too.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.180
Sir,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.860
do you know where my mother is buried?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.300
Follow me.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.780
She was Mount Yao's guardian phoenix,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.460
yet only an unmarked grave
stands for her.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.540
Sir,

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.700
how did my mother die?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.099
You killed her.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.539
What?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.140
How is that possible?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.539
I witnessed with my own eyes

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.099
how your mother sealed
the wicked demon Ying Zhao,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.900
gravely injuring her core.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.140
She used the last of her power
from her phoenix rebirth.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.379
You killed her

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.979
when she was

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.780
at her weakest.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.619
At that time,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.500
your eyes glowed red.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.660
It was the Gu.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.059
The phoenix A'Luan

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.219
helped the world rid itself
of the wicked demon Ying Zhao

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.419
and protected
both the human and demon realms.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.900
Yet, in the end,
she died by her own son's hand.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.100
Such a tragedy indeed.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.900
I'm sorry,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.460
Mother.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.300
I will find the true mastermind

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.060
and make her pay the price she deserves.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.380
But isn't

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.420
the mastermind Xiling Heng?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.140
At first, I thought so too.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.700
Until that night when I saw
the Former Empress's portrait,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.780
I realized
there might be more behind this.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.300
The Former Empress?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.460
What happened?

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.580
The Former Empress Duanmu Jin

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.060
is Ghost Granny,
the masterful Gu practitioner.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.300
Ghost Granny?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.780
How could it be her?

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.900
Looking back
on your previous assessment,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.859
I suspect the Former Empress

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.060
was the one who put the Gu
in the glutinous rice cakes I often ate.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.940
Once,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.180
after eating,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.659
I noticed that glutinous rice cake

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.139
tasted different from before.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.219
I felt unusually excited afterward.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.140
After that, I remember nothing else.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.460
That's probably

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.500
when I was poisoned with the Gu.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.659
But...

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.379
As you said,

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.620
the Former Empress should have
held no enmity towards you.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.660
Why would she do such a thing?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.019
And why

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.180
has she hidden her identity

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.460
all these years?

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.100
I'm afraid

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.020
only Ghost Granny knows the full truth.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.980
Mother,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.740
I will get to the bottom of this.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.500
You won't have died in vain.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.220
This is my mother's
Divine Phoenix Sword.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.300
She used it

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.580
to defeat Ying Zhao.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.580
