"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 4)

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.380
Let me try.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.900
Try it.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.780
It's delicious.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.860
No matter how delicious it is,
you can't eat it for a whole month.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.980
If you don't like it, just don't eat it.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.540
Can you cook some food differently?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.820
Ask Qiu Bei to cook for you.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.260
Who is Qiu Bei?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.140
Spill the details.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.700
Friend.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.380
Classmate.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.700
It's delicious.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.500
It's still delicious

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.020
306

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.420
Tomorrow at 12 o'clock.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.500
Yes.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.740
You have to write down clearly when he entered to the inn.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.780
Write when enter to the inn in this part.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.660
The day after tomorrow at 12 o'clock.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.540
Is that right?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.340
Well, yes.

00:04:20.587 --> 00:04:21.227
Do you remember?

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.580
Okay.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.860
Do you remember?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.740
Me?

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.540
I remember.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.620
Xu Jingxi.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.140
What's up.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.140
Do you want to eat?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.500
I'm coming.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.260
Can I ask a question?

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.740
When you said food is included, you meant instant noodles?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.500
No.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.020
I only know how to cook noodles.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.620
Have you finished the gravy?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.500
What's wrong?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.700
Is it gross?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.500
It's delicious.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.460
Instant noodles are also delicious

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.700
I like this flavor the most.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.420
So.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.340
I can come to the kitchen to cook by myself, right?

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.620
You can cook?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.060
Not really

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.100
I can stir-fry a few dishes.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.860
Sure.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.100
You can use the kitchen to cook.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.820
Well that's fine.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.580
Tell me what you want to cook.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.460
You will cook for lunch tomorrow.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.380
Then I don't need to cook noodles.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.260
OK

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.620
Can I ask another question?

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.620
What are you - the Encyclopedia of Questions?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.020
I'm just a little curious.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.940
Didn't Sis Yun say at noon,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.380
that you don't like to be touched?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.900
And when you hit your head this morning,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.900
is there something with you...

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.500
Are we that close?

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.820
Sorry.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.860
Hurry up and eat.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.220
We have to go out after finishing.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.580
What's wrong with you?

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:24.852
It's okay, I have a stomachache.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.980
Let me take a break.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.780
You're not trying to scam me, are you?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.380
No.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.380
You are trying to scam me by saying
you have a stomachache from eating instant noodles.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.620
Don't try to trick me.

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:46.715
What's the matter?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.100
It really hurts?

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.740
Let's go back.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.100
Can you walk?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.700
You hold my arm.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.460
Be gentle.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.700
Is it very painful?

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.860
I'm sorry.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.420
Thank you for your help.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.180
It's an old problem of mine.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.020
I always have stomachaches.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.300
I always have medicine.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.180
I didn't even ask you.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.260
You don't have to explain to me.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.220
I'm not like you.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.900
Always full of endless questions.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.620
It's called staying curious about the world.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.020
If everyone only cares about themselves,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.300
and aren't interested in anything else,

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.060
wouldn't that be boring?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.940
Okay, you are curious.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.820
Curiosity killed the cat.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.780
You were taking care of someone else.

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:24.612
And you lost your phone and ID.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.700
You ended up here stranded, working to earn money.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.660
Taking advantage of the free food and drink.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.580
That's not boring.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.980
If that day you were the one with a stomachache,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.580
you would also hope someone can help you.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.620
I will come to help you.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.340
When I help people,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.900
I don't feel bored.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.420
Okay.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.020
Then you should rest now.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.780
Thank you.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.820
Hey.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.700
Qiu Bei.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.340
I am sorry,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.500
I can't go to the bar today.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.100
A colleague is not feeling well.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.620
I... I'm a little worried.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.100
How come there's a piece of clothing missing?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.420
Good morning, sourpuss.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.620
When did you get up?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.260
I don't know.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.740
I didn't see the time.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.820
But I think it's been about an hour since I woke up

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.380
I finished washing the sheets and quilt covers.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.940
What time is it now.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.180
Six thirty-five.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.660
Then you really never fail to
wake me up at six thirty.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.260
But after a day of adjusting,
I'm pretty much used to it now.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.500
It might be my biological clock.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.020
I got uip at around the same time at my old job, around 6.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.260
I have a backup number on my old phone.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.300
You can use it first.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.260
You can set an alarm.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.820
Then you can sleep a few more minutes.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.380
This is for me?

00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:55.940
Just use it first.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.540
You are nice.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.700
But this must be a collector's edition.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.140
Can this crack walnuts?

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.100
Give it back if you don't want it.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.100
Your stomach doesn't hurt anymore.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.980
You're in the mood to joke.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.020
I am not that delicate.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.340
I'm just an ordinary employee.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.020
When I had my job before, I was so
busy that I didn't even have time to eat.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.740
It's normal for young people
nowadays to have some stomach problems.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:17.980
Fine

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.180
I'll go out and buy breakfast for everyone.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.540
Perfect timing for a little walk-around.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.580
I'll buy the ingredients you'll need to make lunch.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.580
What do you want to cook?

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.500
I am fine with everything.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.300
Buy what you...

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.380
Buy what the whole group will enjoy.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.020
OK

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.340
Hello.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.380
Hello, check out.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.060
OK

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.060
Let me take a look.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.660
OK

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.660
The deposit will be returned to your account later.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.100
Thank you for choosing Time Inn.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.340
See you next time.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:11:59.620
Bye.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.740
Bye.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.300
Goodbye.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.460
Sis Wen Shan.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.740
You actually went shopping.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.780
Making food for lunch?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.180
Someone volunteered.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.220
What are you looking at?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.100
Nothing.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.540
Sourpuss.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.180
Please help me tie this apron.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.460
Oil will stain my clothes.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.340
Tie it on,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.500
I have oil on my hands.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.260
Please help me pull out my hair.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.220
Hope I'm not interrupting you two.
