[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 15]

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.480
Someone has been there

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.950
and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.479
come back alive.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.120
Who?

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.680
No need to say any more.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.600
I know the answer.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.259
Why did you go to Biluo Palace?

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.890
To steal something.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.810
You stole from Biluo Palace?

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.490
What did you steal?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.120
A coffin.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.750
Why would you steal a coffin?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.960
I needed it for myself.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.200
Where is the coffin you stole?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.030
Tell me about it.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.690
I can put you in it when you die.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.460
To reach Biluo Palace,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.560
we'll have to take
either the western or the southern route.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.810
There are pursuers on the southern route.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.470
They won't make it easy for us.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.170
It's not a tough choice, is it?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.120
Let's just take the western route.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.310
That's a dead end.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.520
Why?

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.540
Because of the Bone Desert.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.630
Foxy Tang,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.310
didn't you say
the western route was a dead end?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.170
Why are we still heading this way?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.680
Down the cliff near Biluo Palace,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.800
there's a hidden cave

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.430
leading straight

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.230
to Taixiao Hall of Biluo Palace.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.079
Only I know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.820
how to navigate this path.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.280
Why do those in Fengliu Shop

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.840
know

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.540
your final destination is Biluo Palace?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.700
How may I address you?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.100
Ghostly Peony.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.770
Hope to see you again.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.000
Goodbye,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.030
Mr. Foxy Tang.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.020
How much do you know

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.720
about Biluo Palace?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.270
I've heard something about it.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.400
The palace chief is surnamed "Wanyu."

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.780
He keeps a low profile,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.170
but never misses a target
when he strikes.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.680
He's an exceptionally
intelligent and resourceful

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.540
man of mystery.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.630
What about you, Shen?

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.840
Shisan Tower got

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.880
more detailed information than that.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.680
Biluo Palace
was originally located in Luoshui,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.420
and had no dealings
with the central martial arts world.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.510
In the reign of the former emperor,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.050
the Wanyu clan
was the most prominent family

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.110
beneath the royalty.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.120
They excelled in astronomy and geography,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.340
with unmatched skills to perform prayers
and rites to avert the evil.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.960
They were highly valued
by the previous emperor.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.030
For 200 years,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.360
they occupied the position
of Imperial Preceptor.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.870
The imperial favor they received

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.079
was unparalleled in history.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.000
Wasn't the previous Imperial Preceptor

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.960
Yique Yinyang?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.430
Thirty years ago,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.350
the then Imperial Preceptor Wanyu Moru

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.030
recommended to the late emperor

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.120
a young man

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.340
with extraordinary talents,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.910
saying that this person

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.280
had a brilliant governing mind

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.910
and could bring peace and prosperity
to the country.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.680
This young man

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.480
said his name was Yique Yinyang.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.150
He was not only skilled in martial arts,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.310
but also eloquent, articulate,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.030
and adept at inducing hallucinations

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.560
to bewitch people's minds.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.330
The former emperor
followed his every word.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.750
It took him less than a year

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.680
to win over the late emperor's heart.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.630
But shockingly,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.720
after gaining trust,

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.829
Yique Yinyang framed Wanyu Moru,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.360
his referrer, for treason.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.120
He not only replaced the latter
as the Imperial Preceptor,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.630
but also acted perversely,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.480
as he abetted the former emperor

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.350
into pursuing immortality.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.710
In addition, he adopted many children,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.600
and secretly trained them

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.100
to be his followers.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.560
Of course,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.600
among all the crimes

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.060
Yique Yinyang committed,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.250
that was the most insignificant one.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.360
Upon becoming the Imperial Preceptor,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.490
Yique Yinyang had even greater power.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.130
He released Evil Pills,

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.480
killed the innocent,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.210
and eliminated his opponents.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.870
He also collected treasures everywhere

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.750
and built four Sky-Ascending Pillars

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.000
with blood and flesh.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.380
He was an unscrupulous
squanderer and evildoer

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.510
who plunged the country into chaos.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.600
I do know

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.010
that Yique Yinyang built

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.630
four Sky-Ascending Pillars.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.560
From my perspective,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.360
those are just

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.200
ordinary bronze pillars, aren't they?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.070
Perhaps...

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.770
he did intend to ascend the sky.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.560
For what?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.220
A chat with immortals?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.960
Possibly.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.160
So,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.560
Wanyu Moru

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.800
left Jiangnan

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.270
in despair,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.580
and built a new Biluo Palace here.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.560
I've noticed...

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.440
that sometimes,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.000
you're quite smart.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.560
And I've noticed that you're irritating

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.620
in most of the time.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.240
Being condemned

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.480
for recommending Yique Yinyang,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.680
Biluo Palace decided

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.159
to stay clear of jianghu.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.390
It thus became
the most mysterious organization

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.850
in the martial arts world.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.750
Wait a minute.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.210
Yique Yinyang and Biluo Palace
are enemies.

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.360
You've been framed

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.830
for have connections with Yique Yinyang.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.960
You've also stolen from Biluo Palace.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.720
Isn't going there equal to

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.180
getting yourself killed?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.270
Chi Yun,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.280
has it never occurred to you

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.650
that perhaps...

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.040
I really am Yique Yinyang?

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.360
Anyway,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.580
you can't be Yique Yinyang,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.710
who brought disasters to the country.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.310
Besides,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.680
those golden eyes
and forehead mark of yours

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680
look pretty nice.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.270
What exactly did you

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.870
make this walking stick for?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.670
I'm injured.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.270
To cross the Bone Desert,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.490
I need a walking stick for support.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.830
After all that careful selection,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.270
you had me cut down this tree.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.430
Then you just spent half a day

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.960
making this walking stick?

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.680
You even carved patterns on it.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.010
How is a plain old branch

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.920
good enough for me,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.650
the master of Wanqiao Chamber?

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.230
Let's eat.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.220
I'm hungry.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.730
Bixiao Pearl is really useful.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.120
It surely is.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.810
[Plum Garden]

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.330
I feel like I can smell the spring breeze.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.080
Right.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.240
This is where Leader lives,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.170
the Plum Garden.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.070
Don't go away!

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.960
Stop chasing.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.970
The Leader is right ahead.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.760
That's your new toy?

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.690
Many people keep pets.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.070
They say

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.430
pets are like family members

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.720
that can bring comfort.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.740
I'd like to give it a try

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.150
and to know how it actually feels.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.270
Pets are good.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.200
When you show care for them,

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.340
they won't hurt you.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.800
So, it's safe to be around pets.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.430
They are perfect
for those afraid of getting hurt.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.950
Now, I don't think that statement

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.950
is entirely true.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.310
Have you given it a name, Leader?

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.300
Without a name,

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.030
it's just a random cat you feed.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.630
It has nothing to do with you.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.470
You're right.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.390
I should give it a name.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.800
I'm Xiaohong. Greetings, Leader.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.440
Today, I came here

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.660
to borrow a person from you, Leader.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.600
Who do you want to ask for help?

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.440
I know Qiaoyi Qiankun

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.150
lives here.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.150
In the Craftsmen's Scroll,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.510
he's the second-ranking

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.630
builder, mechanism master,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.830
and puppetry artist.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.120
This Plum Garden

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.550
and Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.220
were both built by him.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.030
Knowing that much about him

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.120
doesn't mean
you can persuade him to help you.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.380
He's right in the back.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.140
However,
he has a rather peculiar personality.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.950
He doesn't respond to my orders.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.390
Xiaohong,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.920
you stay here.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.460
As you command.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.390
You've sewn the Thousand Curse Needle

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.250
into your meridians to refine it.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
You must hate the guts

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.660
of the person you want to kill, right?

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.870
Qiaoyi Qiankun,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.230
I need you to do something for me.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.490
Hasn't Leader told you

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.910
even he doesn't get to boss me around?

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.240
Who do you think you are?

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.600
I know

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.630
you traded the favor of building

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.670
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion and the Plum Garden

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.840
for Fengliu Shop killing

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.600
Gui Fusheng,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600
who ranked top

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.400
in the Craftsmen's Scroll.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.430
That's right!

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.670
So, now, I am

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.390
the best puppetry artist in the world.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.120
I want nothing

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.360
but puppetry skills.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.840
Do you know anything about puppetry?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.900
If not, just scram!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.510
I'm indeed ignorant of puppetry.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.630
But I know

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.960
that in the Craftsmen's Scroll

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.190
about mechanisms and puppetry,

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.620
you can only rank second.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.200
What did you just say?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.160
Even though Gui Fusheng is dead,

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.080
you're still the second-ranking craftsman.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080
Do you know

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.380
that in this place,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.120
I can end your life anytime?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.870
This place

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.790
is surrounded by magnets.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.920
With just a slight movement of my finger,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.910
the Thousand Curse Needle inside you

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.710
will pierce through your brain.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.440
Enough!

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.270
Stop it!

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:25.870
Killing you

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.000
is a piece of cake.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.960
I already

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.120
told you to stop.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.550
I know you're obsessed with puppetry art,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.790
and that you plan to hole up here

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.630
to build something

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.910
better than Gui Fusheng's works.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:49.860
Unfortunately,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.200
you will never surpass him.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.240
Be it 10 years,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.550
20 years, or 30 years,

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.520
you'll be forever below him.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.350
If that weren't true,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.820
why would you have had him killed?

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.480
Yes.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.240
I truly can't defeat him.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.570
That's why I killed him.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.080
Qiaoyi Qiankun,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.240
I like you.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.510
Too bad that nobody recognizes you

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.770
as the best craftsman.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.960
I know how to make you

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.270
the No.1 artist in real sense.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.400
Want to hear my idea?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.510
What is it?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.460
Destroy all his works,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.390
and you'll be the best craftsman!

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.270
Gui Fusheng created many works.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.440
The most special of all

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.030
is Biluo Palace.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.600
Though I just ate,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.870
I'm hungry again now.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.000
Actually, I'm not really hungry.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.330
I just feel like a snack.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.270
I wish Shei were here.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.270
She can make a feast

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.050
out of a few scorpions.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.080
I wonder how she's doing

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.340
in the Sword Alliance.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.560
Would she be bullied?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.930
Don't worry.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.200
Master Shao wouldn't give her a hard time.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320
I hope so.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.630
But at least please believe

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.790
that I'll never harm you,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.960
alright?

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.870
I wonder

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.980
how Mr. Tang is doing now.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.520
Master Puzhu,

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.800
long time no see.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.240
Master Cheng,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.580
it's been a while.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.940
How has Island Master Wei been?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.520
My master is doing great.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.360
Enough for the pleasantries.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.790
Let's focus on the important matters.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.480
First,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.070
we need to destroy
the bases of Fengliu Shop.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.000
Miss Shei

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.150
wrote down all the suspicious

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.750
imperial transport hubs

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.630
in the Sword King City in this ledger,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.840
and handed it to the Sword Alliance,
so they could be properly dealt with.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.670
As we all know,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.720
there are many great fighters
in Fengliu Shop.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.520
One is Liu Yan.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.080
Another one claims to be

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.550
the chief of the West Palace,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.550
named Xifang Tao.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.630
Xifang Tao?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.870
Tender though she seems,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.240
she's an impressive martial fighter.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.390
Plus, now, even Kuanglan Wuxing

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.150
has fallen into the control
of Fengliu Shop,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.390
and been turned into a human puppet.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.750
You mean one of the Seven Masters
on Tiandu Peak,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.750
Kuanglan Wuxing?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.200
It seems

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.150
Fengliu Shop is stronger

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.010
than expected.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.740
There is something off

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.000
with this matter.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.800
That's right.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.900
So, to make sure all goes well,

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.790
we need Master Puzhu's help

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.550
to wipe out

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.600
Fengliu Shop.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.600
As for the second matter,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600
Master Cheng needs to

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.860
handle it personally.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.440
Tang Lici has amazing martial skills.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.970
Although he's injured now,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.870
ordinary martial fighters
are no match for him.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.600
It was you who lost track of him.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.540
So, the task of catching Tang Lici

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.120
is yours now.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.600
Given Tang Lici's elusive whereabouts,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.020
I'm afraid it's highly inefficient

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.450
for me to hunt after him.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.120
Isn't it more practical to assign me

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.250
to crack down on Fengliu Shop's bases?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.240
Island Master Cheng, how can we

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.790
trouble you to run around?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.200
I know exactly

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.080
where to catch Tang Lici.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.360
Now that the Sword Alliance knows

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.790
Tang Lici's whereabouts,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.320
why issue an arrest warrant

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.960
and look everywhere for him?

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.760
This is Tai'e Sword.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.170
It's a gift from my mentor Jiangnan Feng.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.960
It's the treasure
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.290
It's used to slay demons

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.670
and the crooked.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.350
Evildoers would tremble in the face of it.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.450
Please take it, Island Master Cheng.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.000
Sword Master, stop joking around.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.390
Tai'e Sword is valuable and precious.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.270
It's the status symbol

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.070
of the Sword Alliance's master.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.800
I only have two hands.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.580
How am I supposed to use

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.590
a third sword?

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.120
Tang Lici has excellent martial skills.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.790
Master Cheng,

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.550
please carry Tai'e Sword

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.950
with you for protection.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.320
Maybe it will come in handy.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.870
But this sword is really too...

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.200
I'll also have someone

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.240
assist you.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.569
Master Shao, it seems you've devised

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.079
quite an elaborate plan.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.460
About Tang Lici...

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.480
Master Shao said

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.750
he'd send someone to assist me

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.079
in capturing Tang Lici.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.829
I thought it'd be
some mysterious martial master.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:26.829
Master Shao's jokes

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.000
are going too far.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.350
Why are there

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.290
so many people along the road?

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:33.790
Everyone in the martial arts world

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.120
wants to catch Tang Lici

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.110
for the glory

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.750
of capturing Yique Yinyang alive.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.920
With so many people
hunting after Mr. Tang,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.400
can he still remain at large?

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.510
The southern route is the only road
leading to Biluo Palace.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.270
That's why we've met

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.670
so many people on the way.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.720
If we go faster,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.950
we can intercept him.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.010
Isn't there another road?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400
The western route

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.450
leads to death.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.960
May I ask if you are Master Cheng?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.550
Commander Yu.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.920
I am Yu Furen.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.340
We finally met, Yu Furen.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.920
Why aren't you in the Sword King City

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.110
cleaning up the mess?

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.070
The Sword King died an unjust death.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.960
I've heard

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.560
that Yique Yinyang Tang Lici

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.160
is fleeing to Biluo Palace.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.760
I must avenge the Sword King.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.750
Did you summon

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.010
these jianghu heroes?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.750
I didn't need to summon them.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.110
Just like me,
these fellows from the martial arts world

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.440
are seeking justice for the Sword King.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.970
Mr. Yu, have you considered

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.840
why Mr. Tang's whereabouts

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.520
would be suddenly disclosed?

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.720
Could it be possible

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.030
that Fengliu Shop

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.010
deliberately spread the information?

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.440
Why are you bringing her along,
Master Cheng?

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.110
Do you know

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.640
that this young lady

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.200
is an aide to Yique Yinyang?

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.270
Is

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.510
the Sword Alliance trying to shield

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.370
Yique Yinyang?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.830
Commander Yu,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.620
why give a lady a hard time?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.400
I thought

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.460
you were different from your master.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.110
As a witness, her presence justifies

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.270
the capture of Tang Lici.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.550
That's why I'm bringing her along.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.350
Master Cheng,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.000
do you mean you're also

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.400
heading to Biluo Palace?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:58.920
Yes.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.110
In that case, why don't we go together?

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.240
I'm not used to that.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.800
Goodbye.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:05.840
Senior!

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.910
It's that way.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.490
Let's go.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.780
Move, guys.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.550
[Bone Desert]

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.480
It's so hot here.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.920
How much longer do we have to walk?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.900
We'll arrive in just a moment.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.680
You said the same thing earlier.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.350
At this rate,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.960
we might die here.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.780
We've arrived.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.970
Seriously?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.730
There's nothing but sand here.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.960
Are you delirious from the heat?

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.700
This is my ride in the desert.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.000
It was this ship

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.600
that took me to Biluo Palace.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.930
Can I have a try?

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.640
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.310
Don't touch

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.310
anything inside.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.150
That's the Rock Armor Deity.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.640
He's good at attacking
those intruding into

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.170
the Bone Desert with rocks.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.000
Don't worry.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.480
I'll go say hello.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.550
He'll let us through.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.210
What? You two know each other?

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.830
Foxy Tang, let me play with it.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.590
Just for a bit.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.270
Chi Yun,

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.010
hands off!

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.720
Do you two both think

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.400
that I broke that flying ship?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.240
Even if you hadn't,
the fault was partly yours.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.510
To look on the bright side,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.960
we've set foot on the glaziers,

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.790
which means we're closer
to the destination.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.050
Shen always knows the right thing to say.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.920
How beautiful.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.590
Tang Lici,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.660
how dare you come to Biluo Palace again?

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.170
Let's go.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.640
What a world of ice and snow.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.070
if it weren't for Bixiao Pearl,

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.370
which I got from you, Shen,

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.570
I'd be freezing here.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.920
I don't like this place.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.240
Why?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.790
There are no shadows.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.920
Without shadows,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.070
one cannot hide.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.960
Shen, your Shadow Concealment Technique

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.620
is better than that, isn't it?

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:02.830
What...

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.110
is going on?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.920
It seems

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.900
we need to wait for a while.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.790
For what?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.750
The ice is moving.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.280
T-these ice fragments

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.210
are gathering!

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.550
The Celestial River

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.830
is home to the ice
that wouldn't melt in 10 thousand years.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.560
The ice river beneath your feet

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.400
is formed by

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.810
these pieces of ice joining together.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.960
They move across the river's surface.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.290
Once every three months, for just one day,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.210
these ice fragments
would gather on the river

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.790
to form a pathway.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.200
This is why you didn't hurry on the way.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.480
Even if we had arrived earlier,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.440
we would have to wait

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.400
for the ice to gather,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.330
or we couldn't reach Biluo Palace.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.680
It's not that complicated, is it?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.340
Why don't we

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.390
just step on these ice pieces

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.720
and hop across?

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.360
I advise you not to do that.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.920
These ice fragments

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.270
cannot bear much weight

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.590
before they become a whole.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.350
The water of Celestial River
is bone-chillingly cold.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.880
The coldness kills
when it enters one's body.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.080
Even I would suffer

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.920
from such coldness.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.500
How much longer do we have to wait?

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.960
Be patient, Shen.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.590
Tang Lici,

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.910
come back with me to the Sword Alliance
for a trial.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.640
Master Cheng, you managed to get here

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.640
so soon though you got lost halfway.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.170
How impressive.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.070
Your wounds haven't healed.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.270
You shouldn't fight.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.880
Okay.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.350
Chi Yun.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.040
You'll deal with Master Cheng.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.720
Me?

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.000
Yes,

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:19.640
you.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:22.880
Shen,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.240
take it back.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.030
Don't you go away!

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.690
Master Cheng,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.480
save it.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.880
These ice floes on the Celestial River
have just gathered.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.720
It will take at least

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.750
fifteen minutes

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.240
for them to become strong enough

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.640
to withstand your immense inner strength.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.670
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.110
Only he has the lightness skill

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.200
to safely move

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.190
on this dangerous ice surface.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.270
Therefore,

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.640
during these 15 minutes,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.960
Chi Yun

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.230
would be invincible.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.630
That's right.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.650
This is how good I really am.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.430
He gets cocky easily.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.450
Let me try again.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.530
Is that all you've got?

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.210
I don't think it's working.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.400
How arrogant of you.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.720
A word of caution, Master Cheng.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.960
If you use your special technique here,

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.030
I'm afraid you'll fall

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.830
into the icy river immediately.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.440
Senior!

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.780
Senior, calm down!

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.110
Senior!

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.540
They're right.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:12.770
Don't risk your life.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.080
Impressive.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.120
Let's see how far

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.150
you can go in just 15 minutes.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.590
Master Cheng,

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.360
Biluo Palace is nearby.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.200
Why don't

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.960
we go there together?

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.210
What do you say?

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.830
Senior,

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.440
shall we set off

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:10.790
too?

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.750
I need a break.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.250
Let's go.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.200
Foxy Tang,

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.070
how come the ground

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.670
doesn't feel safe to step on?

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.160
It feels like I'm floating.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.200
You've been here before, right?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.660
Was it the same in the past?

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.500
What happened?

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.600
Why did they suddenly stop?

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.160
Foxy Tang!

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:18.350
Stay back.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.750
The chief of Biluo Palace

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.150
just wants to say hi to me.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.270
Shen,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.840
give me Bixiao Pearl.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.070
Trust me.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.350
I can handle this.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.680
Master Cheng,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.640
I'm afraid

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.240
we'll have to part here.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.790
Careful!

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.440
Miss Shei!

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400
Mr. Tang!

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.350
Shei!

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:27.630
Palace Chief,

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:29.410
should we kill Tang Lici?

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.970
No need.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.300
I'd like to know what he'll do

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.020
this time,

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.420
provided that he can get in here alive.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.640
This is Mr. Tang's Bixiao Pearl.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.260
Why is it...

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.160
Mr. Tang...

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.720
Mr. Tang?

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.160
Mr. Tang?

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.510
Mr. Tang?

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.550
You mean

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.790
this big hole

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.400
is a trap?

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.400
Tang Lici once stole

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.270
from Biluo Palace.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.790
Palace Chief Wanyu
would definitely tighten security.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.190
But...

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.830
isn't it equal to digging a big hole

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.160
right before his house?

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.510
Sometimes the simplest defense

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.640
is the best defense,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.030
especially against a smart man

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:16.890
like Tang Lici.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.790
It's extremely cold here.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.920
He who can manage to get up from the water

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.830
would suffer
a severe power decrease.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.490
This is bad.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:24.440
Look,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.480
the ice fragments
are about to cover the Celestial River.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.440
Mr. Tang and Miss Shei

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.570
haven't come up yet.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.990
What should we do now?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.200
Stop looking.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.120
Even if you go down there,
you can't save them.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.920
You think we need you to tell us that?

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.120
You should go with me.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.880
Where to?

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.040
Biluo Palace.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.050
Fine. We'll go with you.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:47.160
Shen!

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.260
If Tang Lici escapes danger,

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.550
he will go there too.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.320
Let's go.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.000
Mr. Tang!

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.380
Don't go any further.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.510
Mr. Tang!

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.780
Mr. Tang, your arm...

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.170
This is the Icy Flamy Begonia.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.620
It's a precious plant for healing,

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.400
and also a kind of

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.130
poisonous flower containing
the coldness of the earth and heaven.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.620
If one touches the flowers by accident

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.790
or makes

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.710
a loud sound around them,

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.440
they'll grow and break.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.050
Then the harmful coldness

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:08.909
will penetrate into one's marrow

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.360
and end a life instantly.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.070
I was worried about you, Mr. Tang.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.320
That was why...

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:17.550
Shei.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.790
Did you come down here

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.170
in the hope of saving me?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.710
Mr. Tang,

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.150
why would you ask?

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.590
Look around first

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.719
before you continue

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.159
answering questions with questions.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.760
As you can see,

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.590
even with the Rebirth Scroll,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.760
I can't bear many

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.739
of these coldness strikes.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.239
The most poisonous things in the world

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.030
usually

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.400
wear beautiful and delicate

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.960
disguises,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.180
and launch a fatal strike

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.920
when one is off guard.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.440
Isn't that right,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.760
Miss Shei?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.070
Mr. Tang,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.920
what do you mean?

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.450
You knew perfectly well

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.020
that it was a death trap

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.780
down the Celestial River.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.170
Yet you still followed me

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.960
and resolutely came down here.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.690
Were you being foolish,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.440
or...

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.360
did you already know

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.730
I fell into the Celestial River

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.920
on purpose?

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:41.960
You were sure

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.190
that I'd protect you.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.510
You wished

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.550
to gain my trust and affection

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.770
with that act of yours.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.690
Speaking of which,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.960
this kind of thing

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.270
has happened more than once.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.250
Did you have the same idea

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.670
when you saved me last time?

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.320
Your blood

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.030
can save me.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.120
I have been to many places

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:29.880
and heard many stories,

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.480
but I've never seen

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:34.760
such a bond

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.160
between two people.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.350
This looks so much like Liu Yan's style.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.430
He'd go to extraordinary lengths

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.890
to send me the medicine

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.520
that only works on me.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.150
Miss Shei,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.850
what's your real identity?

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.400
Why would you

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.370
have done what you did to me?

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Think carefully before you answer.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.760
I...

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.390
only wanted to save your life.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.220
There was no other reason.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.720
I just wanted to save you.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.000
That was it.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.070
Miss Shei,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.060
congratulations.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.180
You've escaped death once again.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.550
How have you been?

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:46.000
Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.550
How are you?

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.800
Here we meet again, my enemy.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.930
I've only wished all the worst for you.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.070
Like harming me with this trick?

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.230
The power of mystical ice

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.630
can kill you

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.690
through a tiny cut.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.000
If you win,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.450
perhaps I'll meet you.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.670
If you lose,

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.610
this young lady beside you

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.290
will absolutely meet the Grim Reaper.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:09.370
Is that so?

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.600
Let's make a bet then.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.120
We'll find out

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.080
whether or not I can take her

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.080
away from this place alive.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.630
Mr. Tang,

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.340
we've walked for an hour.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.540
Shall we take a break?

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.760
It's truly getting colder and colder.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.420
We'd better

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.470
find an exit as soon as possible.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.320
Mr. Tang.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.720
Bixiao Pearl.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.710
Bixiao Pearl is merely strong enough

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.570
to protect you.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.530
We'll die

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.280
if we both rely on it.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:18.610
And your death

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.960
means my defeat.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.340
I hate to be a loser.

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.340
But what about your safety?

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.400
Mr. Tang!

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.600
Your blood can keep me alive, right?

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.350
This is Biluo Palace.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.920
We're finally here.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.850
Let's go inside.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.540
It's cold out here.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.590
I am a guest member
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.400
and the second master of Camellia Island,

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.200
Cheng Yunpao.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.810
I'm requesting an audience
with the chief of Biluo Palace.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.550
Why is there no response?

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.920
I am Cheng Yunpao.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.570
I'm asking to meet
the chief of Biluo Palace, Mr. Wanyu.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.740
Is there nobody in Biluo Palace?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.070
Just barge in.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.440
That is extremely

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.300
rude behavior.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.960
Come on.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.590
Shen and I came here to seek refuge.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.710
We're asking for shelter,

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.970
so we have to be polite.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.340
But you're here for a manhunt.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.440
Why don't you just get in there

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.410
and ask for your target?

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.610
I don't need to explain anything to you.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.920
What is there to do then?

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.410
Just wait a bit longer.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.920
More waiting?

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.480
To refine the power of mystical ice

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.880
to such an extent...

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.230
Palace Chief Wanyu

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.590
is really something.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.620
Don't move.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.160
Plucking a lone withering plum blossom
while drunk...

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.420
Such sword essence...

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.140
is quite interesting.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.570
There are also traps here.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.000
We'll meet stronger power of mystical ice

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.930
as we go further.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.140
This wall of ice

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.550
is actually air

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.710
condensed by the power of mystical ice.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:06.650
In return, this ice wall

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.360
prevents the cold air from dissipating,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.700
and thus makes this place

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.160
even more bone-chilling.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.270
Palace Chief Wanyu's design

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.070
is indeed quite ingenious.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.400
That is to say,
if we break this wall of ice,

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.480
the power of mystical ice you mentioned

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.480
will be emitted.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.330
But if we don't break it,

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.530
we'll be trapped here till we die.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.660
Bixiao Pearl is on you.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.400
As long as you're not injured,

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.110
such coldness can't threaten your life.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.710
But what about you, Mr. Tang?

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:39.630
Just take care of yourself.
