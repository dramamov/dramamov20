00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.359
Yet you've acted this way.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.119
How dare you shame our family?

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:47.520
Zhiying,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.840
tell me.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.240
Who's the father of the child?

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.960
Only by telling me

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.840
can I stand up for you.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.640
I don't know either.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.320
Wait.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.640
How could you not know? You...

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.159
Your Majesty.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.120
Bad news!

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.920
The Prince Regent's forces
have surrounded the palace.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.319
Let me ask you.

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.519
Where did His Majesty

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.280
and Cheng Ge go two nights ago?

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.719
I don't know.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.439
I'll ask once more.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.840
Where exactly did His Majesty

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.920
and Cheng Ge go two nights ago?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.240
- I truly don't know.
- I truly don't know.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.000
Last chance for you.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.759
They...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.216
They went to Imperial Weaving House
in the west of city.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.240
Imperial Weaving House?

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.759
I got it.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.319
Gao Ji!

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.560
You...

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.120
Why did you kill them?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.960
Protect His Majesty.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.840
He can't leave the palace.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.840
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:59.264
(Imperial Weaving House)

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:22.848
(Accumulated Momentum)

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.639
How dare you!

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.639
You dare blockade His Majesty's chamber?

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.599
Is the Prince Regent

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.960
attempting to kill His Majesty?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.439
General,

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.039
by the Prince Regent's orders,

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.439
we're here to protect His Majesty.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.120
I must report disaster relief matters
to His Majesty now.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.520
Move!

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.560
General Yan,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.408
the Prince Regent ordered
no one enters or leaves.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.400
This sword was bestowed by His Majesty.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.759
If national affairs are delayed,

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.360
how many lives do you have to lose?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.120
Move!

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.080
Your Majesty,

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.479
I arrived late to your aid.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.199
Rise, General Yan.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.759
I saw the Prince Regent's
guards approaching

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:04.599
and sensed trouble.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.719
What's happened?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.280
How should I resolve this crisis?

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.439
There is one thing

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.759
requiring your assistance.

00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:48.448
(Imperial Weaving House)

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:04.800
Nan.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.800
Nan!

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.720
Nan.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.759
Shi Nan is quick-witted and cautious.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.800
Maybe

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.319
he's already escaped.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.199
Was this medicine prepared
as I instructed?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.800
Yes.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.639
Your Grace,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.000
the child you are carrying

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.399
is a royal heir.

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.839
This abortion potion

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.360
must not be consumed.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.720
I have

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.000
the final say.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.040
Ji? What are you doing?

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.199
Your Grace.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.360
Your Grace, are you alright?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.120
Everyone, leave!

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.000
Yes.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.639
Do you know why

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.439
I dare not return power to Shi Yu?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.920
Because I forced him
to kill his own brother

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.600
and the people of Pingxiang
who raised him.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.959
Tell me.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.720
If I restored power to Shi Yu,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.040
would he spare us?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.519
I don't fear his revenge,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120
but what about you?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.839
What should you do?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.959
So you mean

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.519
everything you've done

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.199
was for me?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.720
Zhiying,

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.639
I can't protect you forever.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.800
The only way to ensure your safety

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.120
is through the royal heir
you are carrying.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.839
You don't understand now,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.879
but you will in time.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.040
Everything I'm doing

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.040
is for your own good.

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:10.639
But this child isn't Shi Yu's.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.120
It is his child,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.120
if I say so.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:33.360
Ensure the safety
of the Empress and the royal heir.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.000
If anything happens to them,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.440
I will hold you all accountable.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.399
Send the order.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.000
The feast will proceed as planned.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.919
Open our borders wide

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.320
to welcome foreign envoys.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.960
Ji.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.919
Ji.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:02.639
Your Majesty.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.759
General Yan, thank you for today.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:05.360
Your Majesty,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.440
as you commanded,

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:07.279
our scouts report

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.120
Gao Ji took five or six carts of corpses
back to the dungeon.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.399
His intentions are unclear.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.440
General Yan,

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:13.960
did you see among the corpses

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.799
a man with a badly scarred face?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.600
We examined them carefully.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.840
No scarred man was found.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.159
I think I know where he might be going.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.039
General Yan,

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.519
keep this safe for me.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:30.279
Alright.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.320
Let's go.
