00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.000
The death of 70,000 soldiers

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.710
will bring trouble to even our families.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.560
You have to decide

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.840
whether you're leaving or staying.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.790
You're leaving already?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.350
But what about your reputation?

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.400
I'm a woman too

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.480
and I understand your choices.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.510
But you don't have to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.790
all turn against me.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.560
I never said I would leave

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.680
to marry someone else.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.520
But after all these years,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.080
don't you love your husband

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.680
even a little bit?

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.360
I will not leave.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.870
When Mother passed away,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.800
she left this family in my care.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.750
My husband is dead.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.400
But I must

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.240
protect this family

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.520
for him and Mother.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.470
Lan,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.750
you're pregnant.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.150
What's your decision?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.150
I do not want to leave.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.240
But my father pressured me.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.710
I have to go home

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.910
and give birth to the baby.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.240
I never dared to speak my mind at home.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.590
Now, my husband is gone.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.190
What choice do I have?

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.310
You don't have any children.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.430
You can leave or stay as you please.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.240
But it's not the same for us.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.800
Our children are still here.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.520
It breaks our hearts

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.710
when you pressure us to leave.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.750
Is it so wrong of me

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360
to leave this family?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.120
Alright.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.590
Am I interrupting?

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.590
Will you stop me as well?

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.870
Right.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.910
You and Wei Jun

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.870
were only betrothed,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.520
yet you chose to become his widow.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.710
How could a loyal woman like you

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.200
stand someone like me

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.070
who is leaving so ungratefully?

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.120
Life isn't easy for us women.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.600
And what I care about least

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.240
is the reputation.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.830
So, I'll never hold you back

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.950
with that kind of thing.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.720
I've seen the world
outside Huajing City.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.110
So,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.800
even if all of you want to leave,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.120
I will not stop you.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.000
You make your choices

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.390
about your own lives.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.920
We all understand.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.110
But Ms. Chu,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.390
you shouldn't be saying that.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.560
That's right.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.120
But at present,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.190
Wei Yun is in prison.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.950
You can't leave

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.120
without his divorce papers, right?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.920
I am here today

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.000
because I want you

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.430
to give me a hand.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.880
Let's not make a move

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.560
until Wei Yun gets back.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.040
What Ms. Chu just said

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.680
makes sense.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.960
At this moment,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.920
our priority is to get Yun out.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.120
If you spoke up for me

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.310
just to secure my help,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.830
that really wasn't necessary.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.800
My great-uncle

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.120
is the Duke of Ning's tutor

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.920
but he remains impartial.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.800
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.040
to stop Can Yan in person

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.510
and confront the Duke of Ning.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.800
If there's injustice in Yun's case,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.510
he will also speak out.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.680
I don't need to push him.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.200
(Wei Ya,)

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.310
(how I wish)

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.160
(I did not love you.)

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.380
(Xie Jiu)

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.920
(You always asked me)

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920
(to write to you.)

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.720
But now, I can only

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.830
burn the letter.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.160
You aren't

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160
as heartless

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.630
as you claim to be.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.510
To me,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.560
you're a very loyal woman.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.270
You misunderstand me.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.200
Everything I do

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.830
is for my own benefit.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.870
What could be wrong

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.400
with self-interest?

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.680
Your family only values
legitimate children.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.230
I suppose

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.510
you went through a lot

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680
before you came this far.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.870
No one else knows

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.950
what you have been through.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.430
You don't think I'm heartless?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.830
Soon after my husband died,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.360
I wanted to leave his family.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.430
I only believe what I see.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.240
What I saw just now

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.680
was a loyal woman

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.120
who loved her husband.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But I can't kill myself for my husband

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.270
like Chun tried to do.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.870
I'm a Xie.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.430
I've never been able to control my life.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.560
I have to live.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.510
I must struggle to survive.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.720
I've been struggling all these years.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.160
How could I kill myself

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.040
just for a man?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.240
But I miss him.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.680
I miss him every single minute.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.760
You are not wrong.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.270
You don't need to feel guilty.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.480
Nor do you need to be stuck here.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.160
The world is so vast.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.430
Your loyalty need not be proven

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.120
by a mere monument of virtue.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.150
Thank you.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.510
We have to count on you

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.950
for Yun's case.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.680
Actually, you should not

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.870
have been part of this.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.870
Chu Yu,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.440
I admire you.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.630
But what I said earlier

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.000
wasn't an excuse.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.840
My great-uncle won't stand by.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.240
This is the assurance I expected.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.560
I have always known

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.030
you are the most sensible.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.080
Yeah.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.720
My husband said the same thing.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.200
My Lady,

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.030
Zhang Deng delivered this.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.950
(Gu)
Hope we can meet.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.200
I await your reply.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.080
My Lady,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.030
what does the letter say?

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.150
Gu Chusheng wants to see me.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.120
What for?

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.440
Then, My Lady,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.840
will you or will you not see him?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.750
Of course not.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.100
(Chu Mansion)

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.920
Yu?

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.910
Look, freshly fried dough twists.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.200
They taste best when they're hot.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.120
They're still good when they're cold.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.350
But anyway,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.750
they won't be as crispy.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.920
Come on. Taste one.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.990
I think

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.200
you actually want some.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.390
When you're nervous,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.240
you always eat snacks to calm down.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.280
Others may not know.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.600
But as your big brother,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.440
I know you very well.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.040
Go ahead and eat.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.560
Today,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.240
I'm here to say thank you.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.670
Since there's some wine here,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.270
I'd like to propose a toast.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.120
On the funeral day,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.600
Grand Tutor Xie wouldn't have appeared

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.630
without your help, right?

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.750
Do you know

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.670
where I saw him

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.480
that day?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.240
I'm Chu Linyang.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.030
Greetings, Grand Tutor.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.480
Now that you're here,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.000
why don't you see what's happening?

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.700
(Xie)

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.790
In the 31st year of the Yuanshun reign,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.390
our border was invaded.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.200
Wei Chengyun,
the late General of Cavalry

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.240
defended the city for a whole year,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.870
holding up 200,000 enemy troops.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.480
So, our nation

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.120
won the battle with very few casualties.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.360
His four children, however,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.750
all died when defending the city.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.920
In the 2nd year of the Pinde reign,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.960
North Qi invaded us.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.200
Wei Jingyi, the late General of Command,

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.270
defended the city with 7,000 soldiers.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.240
Even with only 200 soldiers left,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.440
they didn't retreat.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.800
Grand Tutor,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.510
as the Emperor's tutor.,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.200
you should uphold the law.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.510
Does a family of loyal heroes

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.750
for a century

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.750
deserve less than some villains

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.840
who defy His Majesty

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.960
with their flattery?

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.670
Can't these heroes

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.510
keep their descendants alive?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.510
Can't they get some coffins

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.080
and a proper burial?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.200
Grand Tutor,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.480
please have them respected

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.870
as they deserve to be.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.030
Currently,

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.710
Grand Tutor Xie alone

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.100
may not be enough.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.140
To get Wei Yun out,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.110
we still need

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.380
some helpers

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.380
who are close to His Majesty.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.660
Close to His Majesty?

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.190
At this point,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.590
who has a strong bond with His Majesty?

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.110
No one but the Eldest Princess does.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.710
Hope we can meet.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.310
I await your reply.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.350
Flowers in winter.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.830
You've chosen a lovely spot.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.260
Academician Gu, may I ask

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.710
why you wanted to see me?

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.190
Do you have to be

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.900
so aloof?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.780
Are we

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.230
ever close or what?

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.230
I know you've been trying

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.660
to get Wei Yun released.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.350
Why didn't you come to me?

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.900
Right now, you are

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.300
Duke of Ning's precious son-in-law.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.260
You do sound more sure of yourself

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.340
than you did

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.190
back in the southwest.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.070
So,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.110
will you help me?

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.070
The Wei family is finished.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.070
Duke of Ning wants peace talks,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.660
so he won't back down.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.500
Chu Yu,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.550
sticking with them

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.950
will only get you hurt.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.380
So, you're telling me to abandon them?

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.830
Who is being so noisy?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.300
I'm Chu Yu, widow of Wei Jun,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.110
Marquis of Zhenguo's son.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.190
He's Senior Compiler Gu Chusheng.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.540
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.300
Is he the one who came first
in three exams,

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.660
the most brilliant scholar
in the capital?

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.070
Exactly.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.570
(Elegant and Graceful)

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.770
(Li Changming,
the Eldest Princess of Great Sui)

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.950
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.670
Xiang,

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.190
serve some tea.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.740
Yes.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.140
So, you're the man

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.750
the Duke of Ning thinks so highly of.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.140
You flatter me, Your Highness.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.110
Academician Gu,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.780
if you follow me,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.900
you will rise to the top

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.870
just like him.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.260
Isn't it better

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.470
than being someone's son-in-law?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.710
My loyalties lie elsewhere.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.260
I'm afraid

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:24.950
I must disappoint you.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.350
I'm not one

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.780
to impose.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.470
If one day you change your mind,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.140
you'll always be welcome here.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.150
The Weis are in deep trouble.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.540
So, you wanted to see me?

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.310
Yes.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.150
Mr. Gu, the top scholar,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.150
is your stepping-stone.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.190
Or you wouldn't have seen me.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.950
Then, I should

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.430
thank him for his benevolence

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.020
and for helping me to see you.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.150
I heard you arguing earlier.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.620
Academician Gu,

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.710
you tell me.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.580
Shall I help them or not?

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.580
That depends

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.780
on how Ms. Chu pleads.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.670
Ms. Chu,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.670
you're as headstrong

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.950
as people say.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.670
You even dared to set me up.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.670
Your Highness, you're intelligent.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.150
I don't dare to hide anything.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.150
Right now, you are the only one

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.500
I can beg for help.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.340
So, I had this unwise plan.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.390
You know what interests me.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.670
And I appreciate it.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.830
You may rise.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.510
Thank you.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.950
But anyway, the Wei's case

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.990
has nothing to do with me.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.500
Why should I help?

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.150
Your Highness, you are the one

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.300
and only Eldest Princess.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.390
You are a woman of high status.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:13.790
In the past,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.990
Shu Region was flooded.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.300
You went south three times in person

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.500
for the victims and disaster relief.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:20.750
I believe

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.820
a righteous person like you

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.100
won't just stand by.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:26.990
Save your flattery.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.710
You think a little flattery

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.430
will make me help you?

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.470
The Wei family has defended us

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.310
for a century.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.990
With brilliant strategies,

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.030
they were invincible.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.670
Behind this defeat,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.750
there must have been

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.290
(Xue Hanmei, the Princess's follower)
some reasons.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.340
His Majesty always balances
the civil and military forces.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.020
I believe Your Highness won't stay out

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.190
of the Wei's conviction

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.670
or the decline
of the military's influence.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.750
You're interesting, indeed.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.260
It's such a pity

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.670
that a woman like you is widowed.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.710
If you were a man,

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.990
you would certainly

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.710
have a successful official career.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:13.950
But in my opinion,

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.510
a woman can also

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.710
do great things.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.340
I believe you agree, Your Highness.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.820
For Wei Yun's case,

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.300
there's something you can do.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.690
(Qinxi Valley)

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.540
Thank you for your guidance.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.020
If I can get Wei Yun out,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.430
I will be

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.510
eternally grateful.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.990
I'll take my leave.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.190
So, back there,

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.020
you spoke up for Ms. Chu, didn't you?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.670
The Weis are declining.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.670
They need timely help.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.340
If you help Wei Yun to survive,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.780
he will be grateful.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.500
Do you want me to offer timely help

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.540
or do you actually

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.300
want Ms. Chu to be grateful to you?

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.780
The first, of course.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.540
Ms. Chu is devoted to the Wei family

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.660
and Wei Yun.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.950
She behaves recklessly.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.630
But she's as dazzling

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.860
as you were in the early years.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.260
So, my heart softened.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.990
You are a clever man.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.780
But have you considered

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.990
that by helping Wei Yun like this,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.630
I would be making an enemy

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.020
of the Duke of Ning and his faction?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.670
If he and his men really

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.910
try to hurt me,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.260
what can I do?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.750
He is stubborn.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.670
Though the Crown Prince is inept,

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.750
he has never wavered

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.910
in his support for him.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.540
Instead of trying

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.430
to win their support,

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.950
it's better to rescue someone useful.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.950
I didn't expect to hear

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.750
such a plain explanation.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.030
Hanmei,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.150
be careful how you answer.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.060
My entire life

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.150
is devoted to you.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.430
No matter who wishes you harm,

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.630
I will stand before you and protect you.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.750
Even if it costs me my life.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.710
At court,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.060
my position is not so precarious

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.470
that you need to die for me.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.260
But what happened today

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.780
must not happen again.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.190
So, this is why you asked

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.030
to meet me here.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.100
You're the one who wrote to me

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.390
and asked to meet me.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.260
I just found a place

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.430
with fewer people.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:16.990
What's made you so angry?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.140
Chu Yu,

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.910
must you insult me like that?

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.860
How would serving the Eldest Princess

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.990
be an insult?

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.190
Besides,

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.060
earlier,

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.710
you seemed quite eager to help me.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.100
Why do you look reluctant now?

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.270
- You...
- Forget it.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.260
My Lady,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.470
if Gu Chusheng hadn't come,

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.500
was there another way?

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:37.990
Certainly.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.950
I asked you to prepare a man's suit.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.790
Had he not come,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.020
I would have gone myself.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.990
Very shrewd.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.050
(The Court of Judicial Review)

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.630
Why are you still here?

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.100
We can barely protect ourselves.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.470
If you think we can

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.500
protect your family,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.630
you are mistaken.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.780
Just the two of us are here.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.260
Save the righteous act.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.580
Wei Jun was sincere with me.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.300
I would never harm his family.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.100
Shall we make a bet?

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.670
I will get you out,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.340
and you will let me stay.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.510
Deal.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.470
Then, stay alive.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.020
If you can't get out alive,

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.820
I will scourge your family

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.860
and make a huge mess.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.300
I dare you.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.300
Just you wait and see.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.060
In this case,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.670
you go to the Duke of Hu's Mansion

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.950
and get me Song Wenchang.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.190
You did have a backup plan.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.030
Eat your fill.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.730
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.850
(Song Wenchang, Duke of Hu's eldest son)

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.390
Come on. Hurry up.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.380
Hurry.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.620
Yun.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.990
I'm still alive.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.430
Cao Yan is ridiculous.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.470
How dare he torture you?

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.990
I'll kill him!

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.910
Calm down.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.260
I'll say something serious.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.190
I missed the funeral day.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.510
Do you blame me?

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:15.990
Blame my father.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.150
I had the mourning on.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.540
But he didn't let me go.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.660
I almost fell out with him.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.990
Go apologize to your father.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.100
Why?

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.540
You're my close friend.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.230
I failed to help you out of trouble.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.190
I felt really sorry.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.750
Today, I got Ms. Chu's message

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:46.790
and rushed over.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:49.510
Yun,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.190
if you need any help from me,

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.030
let me know.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.990
For you, I'd do anything,

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.990
whatever it takes.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.990
That's not necessary.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.260
Apology to your father

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.670
and it will be a huge help.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.340
My family is in deep trouble.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.670
Your father has his reasons

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.540
to stop you.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.260
But I know.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.100
Your father stays at home in retirement,

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.430
but he still has the military spirit.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.390
I'm sure he won't

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.710
see my family fall like this.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.660
So, apologize to him.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.180
Meanwhile,

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.910
take something to him for me.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.470
Rest assured.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.750
I will always do

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.860
what you ask me to.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:42.970
(Always Peaceful)

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.380
Shilan,

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.510
you're amazing.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.750
As expected, you got first place again.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.510
Just by luck.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.330
(Song Qingping, Song Zhao's daughter)
Theoretically,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.900
(Song Shilan, Song Zhao's second son)
Brother should have won.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.470
You actually tutored him

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.710
for two nights.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.820
He forgot everything.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.030
Look.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.470
He even drew a little turtle

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.580
on his exam paper.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.500
He draws well, though.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.860
You know what? Don't be scared.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.950
If Brother gives you trouble,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:12.820
let me know.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.750
I can make him my new drug tester.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.300
You terrible son!

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.380
Father,

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.950
be reasonable, will you?

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:21.230
Why am I terrible?

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.230
You're pissing me off.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.900
(Be Honest and Impartial)

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.940
You're pushing your father.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.380
Isn't that terrible enough?

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.910
Father.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.270
Oh, Father.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.870
- Father. Father.
- You...

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.220
Father, take it.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.430
(Song Zhao, Duke of Hu)
Why? Try to kill me?

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.460
No way.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.660
The sword is sheathed.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.550
How could I kill you?

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.420
I don't want it.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.110
I can't take the Red Shadow Sword.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.660
You have to.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.220
If you don't help Wei Yun,

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.270
he will have to die.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.870
What does that have to do with me?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.310
Listen.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.460
I haven't punished you for seeing him

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.870
without my permission.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.710
I just did, so what?

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.350
Wei Yun said

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.700
our family was involved

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.350
in Lord of Qin's treason case.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.220
Without Mr. Wei Zhong's guarantee,

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:07.790
our family would

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.590
have perished in Huajing City.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.270
Yun asked me to bring you this sword

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.590
because he was reminding us.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.740
They once helped us

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.030
and we should repay them now.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:18.870
We should?

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.110
You go ahead, then.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.980
- Take it.
- Come on.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.900
- Come.
- Take it.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.020
Take it, Father.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.620
- Father.
- Oh, my back.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.140
Oh, my back.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.980
Are you all right?

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.630
- Father.
- Brother.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.380
- Stop being so willful.
- Father.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.870
How could you push Father like that?

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.940
Ignorant man.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.380
Shut up, the concubine's son.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.870
You know what?

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.790
In the Baidi Valley battle,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.070
seventy thousand soldiers died.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.460
Wei Yun's family

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.460
may survive.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.700
But they'll be punished.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.550
If I help them recklessly,

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:57.940
I will be seen

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.790
as their accomplice.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.220
By then,

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.700
our family will also be doomed.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.790
Whatever.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.110
- You're terrible.
- Father!

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.000
Don't call me Father.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.970
I'm not your father.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.380
Father.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.590
Is your back all right?

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:16.670
Look at her.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.830
You are such a bad son.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.790
See? Your sister

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.220
is a famous physician in town.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.740
Your younger brother

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.350
is even the Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.540
What about you?

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.310
You are practically

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.830
the most famous playboy

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.420
in Huajing City.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.420
Still famous, anyway.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.140
Aren't you ashamed?

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.660
You have no ambition.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.350
All you do is bring trouble

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.420
to the family and me.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.260
What else can you do?

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.460
Could you even be

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.140
a good brother for your siblings?

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.620
- I can't stand it.
- Father.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.030
- Calm down.
- I threw my back out.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.900
Go rub it for me.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.740
All right.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.140
- Be careful.
- Hurry.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:54.980
Hurry.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.310
Father, are you going to ignore this?

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.170
(Thrive and Prosper)

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.020
Be careful.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.510
Move faster.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.420
Father. Father.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.270
Slow down.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.180
What about your back?

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.380
I lied to him.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.460
Otherwise,

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.310
he wouldn't let me go.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.270
Let's go. Don't let him see us.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.870
He ran really fast.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:15.940
He should fight in battle.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.900
- Let's go.
- I'm exhausted.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.750
- Be careful.
- Move.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.680
Come on.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.110
Brother,

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:23.830
this case involves policy

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.020
and it's complicated.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.460
Not as simple as you think.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:27.980
Don't show off.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.870
Move aside. Don't stand in my way.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.930
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.120
The Eldest Princess?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.240
To help His Majesty

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.040
with his throne,

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.800
she married Jinxi Military Governor

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.850
to get his support.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:55.770
So, His Majesty

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.610
highly respects her.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.970
What did she say?

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.240
She said...

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.760
His Majesty threw Wei Yun in prison

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.520
but hasn't convicted him yet.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.610
Do you know why?

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.040
His Majesty thinks the Weis are guilty,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.520
but Wei Yun doesn't deserve to die.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.360
Exactly.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.690
You're very clever.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.760
His Majesty

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.960
won't release Wei Yun

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.280
unless there's a good reason.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.520
It has to be a reason

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.810
that follows the law

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.810
and silences all opposition.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.560
Are you saying

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.330
we'll give His Majesty an out?

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.160
A reason that follows the law

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.120
and silences all opposition.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.440
What can it be?

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:41.770
It should be sentiment,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.130
human sympathy,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.290
and justice.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.400
Whatever it is,

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.410
it won't be easy.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.570
Chun, will you go with me?

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:54.290
Of course.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.160
You've been making efforts for us.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.890
I haven't even thanked you yet.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.810
I will certainly go with you.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.290
Then, Chun,

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.600
please take Wei Shu's tablet

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:05.650
and go with me.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:07.680
His tablet?

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:28.960
Just the two of us will go.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.410
The other ladies will leave eventually.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.250
In that case,

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.480
the fewer people go,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.250
the safer it will be.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.690
I get it.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:42.610
Mr. Wei Jun,

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.730
you're like my brother, too.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.210
I will get Wei Yun out for you.

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:55.270
(Tablet of Wei Jun, Tablet of Wei Zhong)

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:21.070
(Chengqing Gate)

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.170
Who are you?

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.330
Chu Yu from Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.850
With the tablets of my family,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.210
we request to see His Majesty.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.410
Ms. Chu, did His Majesty summon you?

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:35.650
No.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:36.960
Ms. Chu,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.600
why don't you come when summoned?

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.730
If it were going to happen,

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.560
we needn't have been here.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.450
You're putting me on the spot.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.160
We don't mean to, My Lord.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.480
We simply request you

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.730
to inform His Majesty.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.210
We...

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.090
My whole family

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.450
will not leave

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.210
until we see His Majesty,

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.080
even if we turn to stone.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:21.610
Your Majesty,

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.450
the ladies of Wei Zhong's family

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.480
are kneeling outside.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.650
They said

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.450
they would kneel forever

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640
before an audience.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.440
I believe

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.080
they're putting on a show

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.290
and threatening with their merits.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.780
(Tablet of Wei Zhong,
Marquis of Zhenguo)

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.540
(Chengqing Gate)

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.740
(Chengqing Gate)

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:26.020
(Tablet of Wei Zhong,
Marquis of Zhenguo)

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.980
(The Court of Judicial Review)

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.030
What are you doing here?

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.520
I think Yun needs me now.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.880
I will leave.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.150
But before I leave this family,

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.550
I have the duty to come.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.880
Yun is the brother

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.960
my husband loved most.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.840
If I can secure Yun's release

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.400
by bringing his tablet,

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.670
I won't have failed him.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.630
In the past, my husband

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360
loved to play

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.200
with his brothers.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.240
If I didn't come,

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.960
he would be disappointed.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.320
I think this is

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.280
the last thing

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.840
I can do for my husband.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.030
I've been fortunate

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.320
to know you all.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.070
We went through the hardest time.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.550
What does it matter

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.400
