Young Master Rumu, your old injury

However...

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.760
the medicine he used was too potent,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.000
which is why you were unconscious

Rumu, listen to me.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.360
I committed all those evil acts

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.640
because I was possessed by the Black Fox.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.570
None of that was my true intention.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.600
For as long as I can remember,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.840
I've been very clear about

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.370

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.160

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.850
Although my methods

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.560

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.160
I'm not some heinous villain.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.520

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.040

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.320
Do it.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.040

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.120
What's wrong?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.890
Are you afraid of death?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.480
I'm not afraid of death.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.800
I'm afraid

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.700
that after I die...

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.000
you'll be left all alone in this world.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.900
You have to believe me.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.200
Everything I did
was because of the Black Fox's influence.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.240
How could there be a father

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.520
in this world who doesn't love
his own son?

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.760
Stop acting!

where can the souls

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.840
There's no father in this world

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.280
as cruel and immoral as you!

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.080
What I've said and done...

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.080
can't be undone.

was it brought back here.

The Chief had the Divine Healer
treat my injury.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.440
I heard...

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.330

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.760
Yes.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.740
It wasn't easy.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.400
The Master said

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.160
that you still need to rest and recover.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.880

No need.

♪ A toast to the distant, all is well,
then it's all worth it ♪

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.310
I said

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.170
that with your talent,

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.680
you should never lay down your sword.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.390
Fugui.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.770
I'll treasure this gift

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.220
and live up to your expectations.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.100
So what if I must lay down my sword?

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.320
I'll decide my own fate with one strike.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:02.920
Fugui,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.230
I look forward to meeting you again.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.830
The world is so interesting.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.120
I'll live on.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.720
Where am I?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.680
Oh no.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.170
Why can't I remember anything?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.480
Sister?

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.940
Sister, you're awake.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.640
Sister.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.600
Qingcheng?

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.960
Why are you dressed like this?

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.600
Why are you here too?

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.050
What is this place?

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.080
Sister, listen to me.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.930
This is Qianji City.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.520
Qianji City?

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.040
That day, I received news

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.700
and rushed to Wangquan Manor.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.000
The Yiqi Alliance was about to kill you.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.600
I fought with all my might
to bring you here.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.680
Qingcheng,

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.760
there's

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.890
something very important I need to do.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.960
I'm going out for a while.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.290
Sister, are you going to find the Soldier?

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.760
I'm afraid it's too late.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.380
You've been in a coma for 10 full days.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.560
That day, the Soldier used

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.840
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike
in front of everyone.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.100
They believed the prophecy of

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.000
the Third Young Master of Aolai
had come true.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.530
They would never spare him.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.640
I was in a coma for 10 days?

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.140
Young Master Fugui...

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.790
I don't believe it.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.600
I'm going to find him.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.120
Sister!

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.510
Qingcheng!

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.580
Are you alright, Chengcheng?

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.050
Sister, do you think

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.120
saving you from the Yiqi Alliance

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.320
was that easy for me?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.130
In your heart,
there's only your Wangquan Fugui.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.040
Does my life

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.640
mean anything to you at all?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.320
Sister...

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.210
Sister, you can leave if you want.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.440
Just like last time.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.440
I thought you'd leave
and abandon me again,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.920
just like last time.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.520
Here.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.600
Take the medicine first.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.840
I know you're still worried about
the Soldier.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.080
Sister, don't worry.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.400
I've sent people to find out
his whereabouts.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.720
Please be patient,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.480
okay?

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.830
Okay.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.090
Pick whatever you like.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.120
Sir,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.920
I can tell you're from the south.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.160
You've been here for some time,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.600
but every time you only order
a bowl of milk.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.140
Are you not used to the food here?

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.840
I'm fine.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.270
May I ask, are you here for travel
or for another reason?

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:36.980
To settle down here.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.640
Sir, you have good judgment indeed.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.440
The whole Western Regions

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.640
can be quite chaotic.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.680
Only this town is the most peaceful.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.730
From the look of you,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.960
I can tell you haven't yet experienced
the full fury of the sandstorms here.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.400
Sand painting show!

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.520
Well, 1,000 years ago,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.640
the Western Regions was an ocean.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.000
In that vast ocean

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.580
stood Penglai Island,

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.890
home to the dragon clan
led by True Dragons

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.560
and the ancient human kingdom of Qianxia.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.520
The dragon clan

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.160
had a sacred relic,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.400
the Water-Control Orb!

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.630
The dragons' demon powers were unmatched,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.090
making their clan supreme
among all demons.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.360
However, this Water-Control Orb

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.020
was full of murderous energy.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.880
Every True Dragon who used it

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.680
eventually

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.890
turned into a berserk dragon.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.640
It slaughtered ceaselessly

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.680
throughout the Western Regions.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.720
The other demon clans,

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.440
in order to survive,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.670
had no choice but to join forces
with the human race

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.800
to resist the berserk dragon together.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.870
Later,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.280
the Corsac Fox Clan among the demons

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.080
stood out,

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.420
joining forces with the human Li Army

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.520
to fight against the berserk dragon.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.540
That war went on for a long time.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.600
To slay the berserk dragon,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.120
both clans suffered countless casualties

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.640
and nearly went extinct.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.720
Finally, the dragon clan forced
the Li Army

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.760
and the Corsac Fox Clan

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.400
to jointly unleash an ultimate formation—

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.280
the Myriad Blight Formation!

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.680
Though powerful,

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.100
this formation

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.080
drew its power from the lives

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.120
of living beings.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.120
The Corsac Fox Clan and the Li Army

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.580
sacrificed countless members of their own,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.660
and only then

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.710
was the berserk dragon finally destroyed,

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.680
bringing peace to the Western Regions.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.440
If there was the Li Army,

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.020
why is the Western Regions
still so chaotic?

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.200
Rumor has it
that whoever has the Water-Control Orb

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.260
can rule the entire Western Regions.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.360
Where is the Water-Control Orb now?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.680
Let me tell you,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.880
the Water-Control Orb

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.400
was reportedly obtained by chance

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.080
by a group of bandits recently.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.200
That's why the situation here
is so chaotic.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.460
The Water-Control Orb

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.760
might actually be in the Western Regions?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.620
I can't just turn a blind eye to it.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.640
Looks like

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.880
I need to investigate this carefully.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.650
Frozen Grace Spear,

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:32.880
[Li Xueyang, General of the Li Army]

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.960
Li Xueyang.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.720
Hya!

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.200
Hya!

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.240
Wangquan Fugui,

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.400
you've finally comprehended
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.200
The day of breaking the circle

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.440
is near.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.580
Congratulations, Madam.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.550
However, this time you've lost two clones.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:14.540
Should we have

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.080
Jiuwei go deal with the Soldier?

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.840
Jiuwei is a clone

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.760
born from a tail I severed myself,

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.199
specifically prepared to
possess the Soldier.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.530
We can't use it lightly.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.760
How is Guifeng now?

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.639
Madam,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.400
Guifeng has gone to that lowly demon.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.360
Good.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.170
That lowly demon is crucial to my plan.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.679
Send my orders

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.280
to Guifeng to do everything
in his power to provoke hatred

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.070
and revive my Grief Tree

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.679
before the Soldier breaks the circle.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.480
Yes, Madam.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.200
Young Master Rumu, you wanted to see me?

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.360
I heard the Demon Realm has been
unstable lately.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:10.760
Yes.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.580
Now that the Soldier has left
our alliance,

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.840
and with Quan Jingting's

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.840
recent massacre in the Demon Realm,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.810
the situation is indeed unstable.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.040
I'll go with you to subdue the demons.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.200
But the Master said
you still need to recuperate.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.930
Lead the way.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.500
Miss Qingtong?

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.900
Miss Qingtong?

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.720
Come out.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.690
What did you find out?

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.680
Your brother has managed
the city flawlessly.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.060
I made no discoveries.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.680
Then,

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.360
help me pass a message to Madam Yin.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.200
Tell her

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.240
to please help me find out
Young Master Fugui's whereabouts.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.840
Yes, I'll do it right away.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.400
Something must be wrong with this city.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.910
Qingcheng appears to
care for me meticulously,

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.380
but in reality,

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.760
he's locked me up,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.410
depriving me of my freedom.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.160
I need to get out of here
as soon as possible

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.520
and find Young Master Fugui.
