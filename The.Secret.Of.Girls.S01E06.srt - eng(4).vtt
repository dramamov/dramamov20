"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 6)

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.020
Long Island Iced Tea

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.740
I'll treat you.

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.140
Thank you, boss.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.820
You aren't allowed to drink.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.020
Why not?

00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:34.100
The boss treated me.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.380
Not anymore.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.459
Why I have to listen to you?

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.020
The boss wants to treat me.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.740
No, you are not allowed to drink.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.540
Boss, I'll pay for that
drink "whatever" iced tea.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.540
Treating or buying is not a problem.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.700
But the core issue here is
why you aren't allowed to drink.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.900
Oh, right.

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:14.181
Why won't you allow me to drink?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.500
No reason.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.780
Ignore her, boss.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.780
That's how she is.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.540
Get me the drink, I'll buy it.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.820
If I say I'll treat you,
then I'll treat you.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
Keep the money.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.340
Just call me Qiu Bei.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.980
You are so nice.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.180
Thank you.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.180
You should learn to be like her.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.500
Drink slowly.

00:04:51.252 --> 00:04:52.692
I like it if it tastes good.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.020
It tastes pretty good.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.980
As expected, you sing here every night.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.780
Why didn't Xiao Yu tell me?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.780
But to be honest.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.860
You really sing very well.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.060
You want me to thank you?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.420
Of course.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.140
I'm a guest now.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.219
If I praise your singing,
you have to say thank you to me.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.380
This is the most basic courtesy.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.180
Let me tell you both.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.820
I was just passing by.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.700
Then I was attracted by the singing.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.140
But guess what

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.060
I walked in and saw this sourpuss.

00:05:57.637 --> 00:05:58.770
[♪annoying drunk laughter♪]

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:00.060
Sourpuss?

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.180
Yes, don't you think
she has a stern face all day long?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.860
Just like someone owes her money.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.740
But the boss is different.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.740
The boss is nice.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.540
And pretty.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.060
She smiles all day long.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.700
She paid me my salary today.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.020
She gave me an extra 50 yuan per day.

00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:32.125
That's a lot of money.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.540
She even let me take
the day off to go have fun.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.420
Sis Yun is so nice.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.380
Ling Yun is a good person...?

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540
You don't agree.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.300
I agree.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.300
Agree to what?

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.020
She's pretty and nice.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.420
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.540
I'll return the 100 yuan
I borrowed from you.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.740
Hey, this one is torn, so give it to you.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.780
Thank you for letting me sleep for a night.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.420
Hey, think clearly before you speak.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.460
What do you want to think clearly about?

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.180
You think it's torn?

00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:22.451
Then I'll give you a new one.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.780
What's going on?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.820
Qiu Bei.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.460
I'm telling you something from my heart.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.419
The drink you mixed for me.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.060
No, that "whatever" iced tea.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.860
It's quite tasty.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.620
The only problem with it is.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.580
It's hitting me hard.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.740
Already drunk?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.819
What are you talking about?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.020
I can hear you.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.059
I told you she couldn't drink.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.100
You insisted she drink.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.020
Well you take care of her.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.700
Wen Shan.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.580
How can you just watch without caring?

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.219
Didn't I try to stop her from drinking?

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.379
You insisted on treating her.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.620
Now you are responsible for it.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.099
I thought she had no
money, so I treated her

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.780
I don't know she couldn't drink it at all.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.580
What are you talking about?

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.060
I can drink!

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:35.499
Another cup of "whatever" iced tea.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.580
Keep drinking.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.100
Don't move.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.100
Don't move.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.540
We're almost there.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.140
I'll leave her to you.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.620
I'm worried about Ling
Yun being alone at home.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.860
If she starves to death
I will say it's your fault.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.739
Go ahead and leave it to her.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.660
It's okay.

00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:56.780
You are disloyal.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.940
Bye.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.060
Make way! Her highness returns to court.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.979
I didn't take my bag.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.980
What do you even have left in there?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
That makes sense.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.380
Let's go.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.140
Xu Jingxi

00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.259
I really owed you in my last life.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.540
Go faster or I'm going to vomit.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.700
I'm not drunk.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.180
Oh my God.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.380
I'm sorry.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.420
Let me help you.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.580
Don't touch me.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.620
Hold on to me.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.580
Why am I...

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.620
not trying to resist her as much?

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.300
Stop it, it's so itchy.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.660
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.700
Are you drunk?

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.260
No.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.500
I'm leaving, let me go.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.099
Why are you holding onto me?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.100
You are holding onto me.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.340
Let's go to sleep.

00:11:30.108 --> 00:11:31.388
Please don't leave.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.940
Don't leave me alone.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.220
They don't even want me anymore.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.620
Why are you in my room?

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.140
When did you come in?

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.099
What happened?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.620
Who allowed you to sleep with me?

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.060
Say something.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.740
Xu Jingxi.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.160
If you drink again.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.340
I will kill you with my own to hands.
