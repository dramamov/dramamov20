00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:41.628
Stop it!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.548
Father.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.468
Ms. Wang and I love each other.

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:49.188
Please permit us.

00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:53.628
Xue Hexu, get out!

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:57.509
Get up.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.268
Father.

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:01.268
This is a grave matter.

00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:02.548
Secret chamber now.

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:04.149
What? I won't go.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.628
Come on.

00:02:04.628 --> 00:02:05.188
I...

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.789
Come on.

00:02:07.468 --> 00:02:08.788
Secret chamber?

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:11.788
They hid it from me.

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.109
Fools.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.549
Wish to die together?

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:35.269
(Secret chamber?)

00:02:35.908 --> 00:02:36.829
(They lied to me.)

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:47.149
Father.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.829
Whenever you tell me secrets, you always

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:50.668
bring me here.

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.628
Do you know
your mother lies in this tomb?

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:57.480
(Beloved Wife of the Xue Family)

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:01.908
(In the late night,)

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:03.549
(they're here to a tomb?)

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:05.668
(Their whole family)

00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:07.748
(soon to reunite in here.)

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.348
Whether she lives or dies,

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.389
I'll never betray her.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:13.668
Only here

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.709
can I speak freely.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.389
Then why keep an illegitimate child?

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.348
He's born on the same day as me.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:23.829
Stop the nonsense.

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.109
I've met Youshou.

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:26.549
When I

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:27.748
took over the household,

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.029
I went south

00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:30.549
and met him.

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:32.508
You met him behind my back?

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:35.309
Is he your illegitimate son?

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.389
Don't lie to me before Mother's tomb.

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:43.816
(Beloved Wife of the Xue Family)

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.788
I've always known

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.549
such a lie

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.628
would be revealed eventually.

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:51.976
(Beloved Wife of the Xue Family)

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:53.948
Xue Youshou

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:56.668
is the former Crown Prince,

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.389
Jia Xun.

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:00.109
What?

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:04.468
(Xue Youshou is indeed
the former Crown Prince.)

00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.589
I've loved your mother

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:09.869
wholeheartedly.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.429
I owed a favor to the late Empress,

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:15.589
swore to protect her young son.

00:04:15.948 --> 00:04:16.428
Thus,

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.908
risking my life,

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.228
I brought him into our family.

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:22.468
But

00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:24.788
I couldn't hide him for long.

00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:27.509
I asked old contacts

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.348
to send him south,

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.428
and provided funds for his care.

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.189
For over a decade,
I've been living in fear.

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:36.428
But Father,

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:39.348
do you know your old contacts

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:41.149
took all that money?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:43.389
Youshou...

00:04:43.668 --> 00:04:44.149
No,

00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:45.749
Jia Xun

00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:48.348
has lived a tough time all these years,

00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:49.269
malnourished and gaunt.

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.629
Do you know any of this?

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:52.029
What?

00:04:57.308 --> 00:04:58.069
Everything

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.709
is fated.

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.308
I only wished him a peaceful life,

00:05:05.668 --> 00:05:06.908
free from trouble.

00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:11.428
Yet he suffered so.

00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:15.509
This is all my fault.

00:05:17.468 --> 00:05:18.509
What fault is yours?

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.468
I've wronged you for so long.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.709
Just blame

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:24.069
the current Emperor.

00:05:24.308 --> 00:05:25.668
His ruthless pursuit of power

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:27.308
caused such a tragedy.

00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:28.788
Son, have you gone mad?

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.548
Don't say such words!

00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:32.308
(The Xue family)

00:05:32.988 --> 00:05:35.308
(is quite loyal to the late Empress.)

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:37.788
How do I...

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:40.709
Heaven blesses me.

00:05:40.988 --> 00:05:43.829
We meant no disrespect to His Majesty.

00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:44.589
Son.

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:46.829
Father.

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.348
I'll go south now

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.468
to warn Youshou.

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:50.468
Don't!

00:05:51.548 --> 00:05:53.509
Ms. Wang married into our family

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:54.949
to find him.

00:05:55.468 --> 00:05:57.029
Grand Tutor Zhou has made his move.

00:05:57.428 --> 00:05:59.629
How could we possibly fight against

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.829
Jing'an Bureau and Xue Guardian?

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:02.788
Then,

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.829
are we supposed to just watch

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.029
Youshou die?

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.069
Our Xue family

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.908
has already done well enough
to the former Crown Prince.

00:06:14.788 --> 00:06:17.428
Now everything's ruined.

00:06:18.308 --> 00:06:19.749
I've failed him.

00:06:20.908 --> 00:06:21.548
Son,

00:06:22.788 --> 00:06:25.468
we must prioritize the Xue family.

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:27.029
But Father,

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:29.629
Youshou did nothing wrong.

00:06:30.428 --> 00:06:31.788
I, Lord Dingyuan,

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:34.269
have done well enough

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:37.029
to the late Empress!

00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:38.988
I know

00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:41.589
you stopped us today

00:06:41.788 --> 00:06:44.189
to interrupt her investigation.

00:06:46.308 --> 00:06:47.548
But son,

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:49.428
don't make

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:51.908
such jokes anymore.

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.108
I'm already old.

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.069
I'll go find Ms. Wang

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:00.389
and tell her

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.788
Xue Youshou's whereabouts.

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:14.308
Father.

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.709
Forgive me.

00:07:18.108 --> 00:07:19.908
I learned this from Gu Qianfu.

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:20.749
Impressive!

00:07:25.788 --> 00:07:27.308
How much longer to keep this from me?

00:07:32.548 --> 00:07:34.108
The conversation you just had with him

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:35.868
was ridiculous!

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:37.668
We must obey

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:39.949
whatever the Emperor says.

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:41.348
Understand?

00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:42.868
The Emperor asked you

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.629
to take the poison before.

00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:47.029
You serve him with loyalty,

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:48.988
yet he can kill you any time!

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:51.509
Is being someone's pawn

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:52.829
what you desire?

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.629
Ridiculous!

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:54.829
Wang Feng.

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.749
I've told you

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:58.348
the most precious thing in this world

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:00.029
is one's life.

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:02.589
It's none of your business.

00:08:03.228 --> 00:08:04.589
Just hand over Xue Youshou.

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.868
Xue family'd be safe.

00:08:06.468 --> 00:08:08.149
He could kill you any time!

00:08:08.668 --> 00:08:10.829
What do you have to bargain with him?

00:08:11.668 --> 00:08:12.189
I know.

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:13.389
Recently,

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:14.988
you've been worried about

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:16.029
this matter.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:17.788
But in this vast world,

00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:19.069
I believe

00:08:19.308 --> 00:08:21.069
there'd be a safe place
for the Xue family.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:24.328
Once the one dies, and the Crown Prince
ascends the throne,

00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:25.509
then all will pass.

00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:29.389
How could we possibly

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:31.149
escape the hunt down?

00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:32.509
The Xue family

00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:33.668
and I

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.389
will ensure your safety.

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:39.908
You insist on

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.428
choosing the tough path.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.149
Enough talk!

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:44.328
I'll go find Jia Xun.

00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:47.629
I swear

00:08:48.068 --> 00:08:49.068
I truly love Wang Feng.

00:08:51.109 --> 00:08:52.229
Well, well, you two!

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:53.428
I caught you.

00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:54.749
Come with me.

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:56.548
Let's see who dares stand up for you.

00:08:57.188 --> 00:08:58.389
You two, take the master away.

00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.792
Yes.

00:08:58.792 --> 00:08:59.269
I...

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.389
I didn't even imagine

00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:08.629
that you two dared to do that!

00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:09.828
If this gets out,

00:09:09.989 --> 00:09:11.229
the Xue family is finished.

00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:13.109
What do you mean?

00:09:13.308 --> 00:09:14.229
Explain it.

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:15.828
Jiaoqian, calm down.

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:17.588
She means,

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:19.188
Hexu and stepmother

00:09:19.588 --> 00:09:21.788
have developed an unethical relationship

00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:23.428
that violates morality.

00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:28.469
How could
such a ridiculous behavior be allowed?

00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:32.188
A storybook tale coming to life!

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:33.229
- Not true.
- Not true.

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.749
I see no wrong
in my affection for Ms. Wang.

00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:40.828
My love is sincere.

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:43.109
We shouldn't be bound
by status or conventions.

00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:45.708
We weren't discussing this.

00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:50.828
(This is straight out
of a storybook tale.)

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:53.629
(Protagonists resisting feudal ethics)

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:54.948
(take the blame for each other.)

00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:57.149
You two!

00:09:57.749 --> 00:09:59.389
Can't believe you did that!

00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:01.629
This is disgraceful!

00:10:02.109 --> 00:10:03.869
Try to deny it and escape from blame?

00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:05.308
How dare you!

00:10:08.229 --> 00:10:09.000
Wait, Jiaoqian.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.068
What does this all mean?

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.188
All I know is I love Ms. Wang.

00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:14.509
I really mean it.

00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:15.708
Can't I do so?

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:20.389
Xue Hexu!

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:27.188
You!

00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:29.428
You!

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:34.349
How could you be so ridiculous?

00:10:35.229 --> 00:10:36.629
What a misfortune!

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:39.989
How dare you justify yourself!

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.349
Showing no remorse.

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.869
Old Madam.

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:45.269
You mistook us.

00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:47.229
Between him and me,

00:10:47.469 --> 00:10:49.668
it's always been
a stepmother-and-son relationship.

00:10:50.428 --> 00:10:51.749
The Lord remains unconscious now.

00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:52.869
I should

00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:54.668
go take care of him.

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:04.029
My Lord.

00:11:04.948 --> 00:11:05.749
Wake up!

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.668
Wake up!

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:27.188
Hexu is truly pathetic!

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:29.068
Wake up!

00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:30.668
Wake up!

00:11:32.828 --> 00:11:34.708
You said to tell me
Xue Youshou's whereabouts.

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:37.989
I'm begging you, wake up!

00:11:47.788 --> 00:11:48.708
Oh, no!

00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:51.208
Hexu left a letter
and ran away from home!

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:55.788
In his letter, Hexu asked,

00:11:56.668 --> 00:11:58.749
"What is love exactly?

00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:01.629
Why can it tear my heart?"

00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:04.588
He's so despairing,

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:08.749
wishing to run away
from this heartbreak place.

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:11.229
Like a kite with its string cut,

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:14.389
vanishing in the skies.

00:12:16.948 --> 00:12:18.828
(Why would Xue Hexu be despairing?)

00:12:21.188 --> 00:12:22.029
Nonsense!

00:12:22.749 --> 00:12:25.469
Did his letter mention where he's going?

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:29.788
He said
there's no joy left in this world.

00:12:31.349 --> 00:12:32.788
Even wishing

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:36.308
to stop time at the moment
before everything happens.

00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:38.629
He claimed

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:40.908
he's at the cliff's edge,

00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:43.229
ready to leap

00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:45.708
for final liberation.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.828
It's all my fault!

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.908
I was too harsh on him yesterday,

00:12:52.349 --> 00:12:54.509
making him despairing.

00:12:55.869 --> 00:12:57.788
(Nonsense!)

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.149
Grandmother.

00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:12.584
(I left. Don't worry.)

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.269
You girl!

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:27.509
Is it funny?

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:29.548
Just a few words left,

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:32.068
but Hexu and I share blood ties.

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:33.668
I understand his pain.

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:35.509
He must feel the same.

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:38.708
(He)

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.269
(must've gone south
to find Xue Youshou.)

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:44.269
(Xue Hexu definitely went south
to find Xue Youshou.)

00:13:52.828 --> 00:13:53.869
Set off now

00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:56.389
to find the former Crown Prince

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.149
before Xue Guardian.

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:00.428
I understand.

00:14:01.068 --> 00:14:02.629
I'll spare no effort.

00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:05.428
However,

00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:08.828
what about travel expenses?

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:10.908
Could you

00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:12.749
provide me some funds

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.588
to facilitate my mission?

00:14:18.308 --> 00:14:20.828
The Jing'an Bureau values frugality.

00:14:22.948 --> 00:14:23.908
You

00:14:25.668 --> 00:14:26.749
haven't started working,

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:30.029
yet already asking for money.

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:37.869
Mine.

00:15:50.948 --> 00:15:51.908
Mine.

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:54.668
Grand Tutor.

00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:56.749
Two copper coins

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.349
can't even rent a horse.

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:02.229
Why needs horses?

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:04.588
If you can complete the mission

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:06.509
without spending money,

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:08.749
that's real skill!

00:16:14.788 --> 00:16:15.749
You are right.

00:16:16.588 --> 00:16:17.908
I'll do my best

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:19.828
to meet your expectations.

00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:28.548
Complete the mission

00:16:28.828 --> 00:16:30.229
without spending money.

00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:37.908
This is
the former Crown Prince's portrait.

00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:49.149
(This...)

00:16:49.548 --> 00:16:51.308
(This is the man I chased
two years ago?)

00:16:57.229 --> 00:16:58.948
She loves me? Not at all?

00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:00.828
She loves me? Not at all?

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:03.428
She loves me? Not at all?

00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:04.229
She loves...

00:17:05.229 --> 00:17:05.828
Stop!

00:17:06.548 --> 00:17:07.068
Darn it!

00:17:15.509 --> 00:17:16.469
That brat is so agile,

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:17.788
vanished in a blink.

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:19.548
He can't go far.

00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.509
Go!

00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:21.148
Go!

00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:39.588
- After him!
- Go!

00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:06.229
Where's he?

00:18:06.388 --> 00:18:06.828
Where's he?

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.749
Hurry!

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:43.308
Let's go!

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:17.469
The brat is over there!

00:19:17.469 --> 00:19:17.909
Chase him!

00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:18.388
Yes!

00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:25.949
That brat is so agile.

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:28.548
He can't go far.

00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:30.068
Search him.

00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:48.872
(Restroom? 10 li south.)

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.384
(Restroom? 10 li south.)

00:20:28.989 --> 00:20:30.588
I knew this trick works.

00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:31.189
Go!

00:20:56.628 --> 00:20:57.189
Lord Xue.

00:20:57.269 --> 00:20:58.229
Who told you to do so?

00:20:58.749 --> 00:20:59.909
You said to take him down.

00:21:00.068 --> 00:21:01.749
Capture him,

00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:02.709
not kill him.

00:21:05.628 --> 00:21:07.949
Xue Hexu is crucial to this case.

00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:09.989
Keep him alive.

00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:11.749
From now on,

00:21:12.429 --> 00:21:14.068
I'll follow him myself.

00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:15.348
You cover the rear.

00:21:15.828 --> 00:21:16.669
Stay hidden.

00:21:17.229 --> 00:21:17.709
Understood.

00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:33.348
You...

00:21:33.469 --> 00:21:34.588
You went out alone,

00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:35.909
how bold!

00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:38.108
I won't waste time rescuing you.

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.709
Wang Feng.

00:21:39.868 --> 00:21:40.469
Why come here?

00:21:40.709 --> 00:21:43.148
You want to tip off Xue Youshou.

00:21:44.068 --> 00:21:44.469
Wait.

00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:47.308
I'm heartbroken. Got rejected.

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:48.709
Just taking a walk.

00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:51.388
Here?

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.469
Yes.

00:21:53.388 --> 00:21:54.469
I'm heartbroken.

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:55.669
You rejected me.

00:21:55.989 --> 00:21:57.108
You know I love you,

00:21:57.189 --> 00:21:58.029
yet you reject me

00:21:58.348 --> 00:21:59.068
even detest me.

00:21:59.269 --> 00:22:00.269
I'm so heartbroken...

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:02.828
Does it matter now?

00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:05.548
Don't think I won't

00:22:06.148 --> 00:22:07.148
kill you.

00:22:11.108 --> 00:22:13.096
Don't think you can do

00:22:13.096 --> 00:22:13.828
whatever you can.

00:22:17.989 --> 00:22:19.348
Disrespect Lord Xue?

00:22:19.628 --> 00:22:20.148
How dare you!

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:20.949
Stop!

00:22:22.229 --> 00:22:22.788
Lord Xue,

00:22:23.189 --> 00:22:25.628
someone muttered insults to you,

00:22:25.709 --> 00:22:26.868
and you severed his hands.

00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.989
You taught

00:22:28.308 --> 00:22:28.949
us to

00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:31.469
tolerate no disrespect.

00:22:31.949 --> 00:22:32.548
He's different.

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:35.388
He was praising me,

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:36.348
but

00:22:37.429 --> 00:22:39.308
in an unconventional way.

00:22:40.308 --> 00:22:40.989
Even so,

00:22:41.509 --> 00:22:43.108
he obstructs our operations constantly.

00:22:43.469 --> 00:22:44.068
Deserves death!

00:22:44.548 --> 00:22:46.388
How will we complete the mission then?

00:22:47.108 --> 00:22:48.509
We need him to find Xue Youshou.

00:22:52.068 --> 00:22:53.068
What now?

00:22:53.509 --> 00:22:53.989
Nothing.

00:22:54.229 --> 00:22:55.509
I don't like to see his face.

00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:56.469
Then just close

00:22:56.588 --> 00:22:57.029
your eyes.

00:22:58.949 --> 00:22:59.548
Lord Xue.

00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:00.749
This Xue Hexu

00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:01.788
should've died many times

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:02.868
by our protocols.

00:23:03.388 --> 00:23:05.388
Yet you keep sparing him.

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:06.868
You must be...

00:23:11.628 --> 00:23:12.509
What?

00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:17.029
Fishing for bigger prey.

00:23:17.628 --> 00:23:18.548
We acted rashly.

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:22.148
Exactly.

00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:23.709
Since you've noticed it,

00:23:23.709 --> 00:23:24.509
sheathe your swords

00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:25.348
and go away.

00:23:25.788 --> 00:23:26.469
Yes!

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.669
Go!

00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:34.429
Xue Guardian?

00:23:34.989 --> 00:23:37.868
It's Emperor Jia's shadow force,

00:23:38.148 --> 00:23:39.509
wielding immense power

00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:41.588
with ruthless methods?

00:23:41.949 --> 00:23:42.548
Xue Guardian?

00:23:43.108 --> 00:23:43.588
Exactly.

00:23:44.229 --> 00:23:46.348
Cloth workshop owner,
new bride of the Xue family.

00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:47.989
These are my disguises.

00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:50.669
How many more are you hiding from me?

00:23:52.108 --> 00:23:52.989
I thought

00:23:53.388 --> 00:23:55.108
you run errands for the imperial court.

00:23:55.588 --> 00:23:56.308
Never imagined

00:23:56.989 --> 00:23:58.949
you'd be the head

00:23:59.269 --> 00:24:00.029
of Xue Guardian.

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:03.189
Scared?

00:24:03.628 --> 00:24:04.148
No.

00:24:05.348 --> 00:24:06.148
I feel pain

00:24:06.788 --> 00:24:08.429
to what you've been through.

00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:09.189
Wang Feng.

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:11.029
Wang Feng. How did you survive?

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.909
Don't call me that.

00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.788
It sounds awful.

00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:18.509
I'm Feng Zuoren.

00:24:19.348 --> 00:24:20.588
Feng Zuoren.

00:24:21.388 --> 00:24:22.949
What a good name.

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:25.189
Can I call you Feng?

00:24:26.628 --> 00:24:27.348
No.

00:24:29.628 --> 00:24:30.669
Call me Miss Feng.

00:24:31.749 --> 00:24:32.588
Tell me,

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:34.269
where is Xue Youshou?

00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:37.588
Feng.

00:24:37.828 --> 00:24:39.388
But I'm not looking for Xue Youshou.

00:24:40.189 --> 00:24:40.868
That's it.

00:24:42.068 --> 00:24:42.749
I won't

00:24:43.868 --> 00:24:45.189
hinder your missions.

00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:46.828
And you won't accept my love.

00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:48.788
So I have to achieve something grand,

00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:50.788
to make myself worthy of you.

00:24:53.068 --> 00:24:54.269
I'll take my leave now, Feng.

00:25:04.949 --> 00:25:06.120
Men

00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:07.828
love to lie.

00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:09.348
Let's go.

00:25:10.348 --> 00:25:10.749
Feng.
