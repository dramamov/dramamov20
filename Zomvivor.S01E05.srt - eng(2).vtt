00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:15.385
So, it was you who let Pao out?

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:26.905
Why did you do that?

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.345
-I--
-You know many people died because of you?

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:39.105
I didn't mean to.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.625
-I didn't know.
-How could you not?

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.145
You saw what he did to the PE students!

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:45.065
Hey.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.905
San, do you think blaming her
will bring back the dead?

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:00.545
Where are Ning and Jean?

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:04.305
Why didn't you come back together?

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:06.225
Pao, Ning and Jean ran away with Aek.

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:08.545
But we have no idea where.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.465
They are with Aek.
They can look after themselves.

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:16.985
No.

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:24.745
That's not true.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.305
What the hell?

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.385
Huh?

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:33.065
My brother won't keep him alive.

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:36.145
He definitely got killed.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:38.865
What's wrong with you?

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:43.665
Hey! The zombies are coming!

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:45.865
Thi, zip it! Don't make any sound.

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.825
The sound of rain
drowns out the sound in here.

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:58.425
Listen to me.

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:01.305
From now on…

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.385
all of you will take orders from me.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.505
Only me.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:08.905
Got it?

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.425
I found a Japanese article.
I asked my friend to translate it.

00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:26.465
The immortal jellyfish were
infected with a parasite called Myxozoa.

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:30.905
Typically, this parasite
doesn't affect the host's behavior.

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.785
But in the seas around Japan,
they found that the parasite

00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:35.985
caused the immortal jellyfish
to form groups

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:37.625
and attack other marine animals.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:40.665
Some are turning on each other.

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.305
A research team in Japan
conducted an experiment

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:48.945
keeping both infected and uninfected
jellyfish in controlled conditions.

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.625
They found that the infected ones

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:55.225
regenerated their tissue
faster than the uninfected ones.

00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:59.665
The article said that they were
very excited about the discovery.

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.785
Obviously, nothing should be done
with this jellyfish.

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:06.545
Did you not know
that Wiroj brought them to make serum?

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:07.905
Yeah, I had no idea.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.265
He kept me away,
wouldn't even let me in the lab.

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:15.705
When I first realized it was possible,
I asked him to bring them to our lab.

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.705
But he didn't listen to me.

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.305
And when I found the paper,
I sent it to him.

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:39.705
I was too late.

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.705
I sent it to him too late.

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.145
He already used them to make the serum.

00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:53.505
It might not be related.

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:57.825
He may be working on another project
or something else.

00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.425
Jean, I'm not that stupid.

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:03.945
This project is top secret.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:09.585
The best subjects are those
who have no choice at all.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:12.705
He'd have brought alien labor if he could.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:13.865
He wouldn't.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:15.905
He's not that cruel.

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:17.624
I wasn't talking about Wiroj.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:30.785
I'm sorry for talking like that.

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.345
But I really do believe it.

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:36.385
No.

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:39.345
We can't just speculate like this.

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:41.505
There's no proof.

00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:48.585
I will go to Wiroj's office.
He's got a safe in there.

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:49.545
I'll go with you.

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.665
No, you stay. I can go by myself.

00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:52.745
I'm going.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:57.705
But I don't think that you should
see that place again.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:05.905
It's okay, I can handle it.

00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:46.545
Kanchana, please wake up.

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:48.305
Please.

00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:52.585
I'm begging you.

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:56.345
Please wake up!

00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:00.505
It wasn't your fault.

00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:09.505
The one to blame
is the one who drove him crazy…

00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:13.785
and the one who locked him up.

00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:21.705
If that was your friend…

00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:25.185
you wouldn't be saying this.

00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:29.865
Make no sound now.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.425
I wouldn't blame you
even if it was my dad.

00:08:35.024 --> 00:08:37.945
I wasn't your fault. You're just stupid.

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:44.024
Thank you.

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:52.905
These people

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:56.385
believe that they are supposed
to be the leaders.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.225
They'll do whatever it takes
to be in front.

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:06.265
Because that makes them special.

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:11.305
When they can make things go their way
or when they get to boss people around.

00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:16.585
And when these people make mistakes,

00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:19.625
you know
what's the first thing they'll do?

00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:27.545
They will find someone…

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.945
and make the most useless one
take the fall.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.225
Yesterday it was Pao.

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:42.785
Today it was you.

00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:46.385
It'll be someone else tomorrow.

00:09:50.065 --> 00:09:51.825
But it will never be them.

00:09:57.065 --> 00:10:00.225
There's a way for you to help yourself
without relying on men.

00:10:00.825 --> 00:10:01.985
Do you want to know how?

00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:09.425
How?

00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:13.945
If you don't get rid of them
and take their place…

00:10:15.225 --> 00:10:17.025
you find out their secrets.

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:28.105
Wanna know the frontliners' secret?

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:27.105
San.

00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:53.745
It'll be all right.

00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:55.585
You'll be okay.

00:12:06.665 --> 00:12:08.905
Damn, San is so fucking cool!

00:12:12.385 --> 00:12:13.465
How much was it?

00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:14.705
It was 20 fucking grand.

00:12:14.785 --> 00:12:17.585
That didn't even include
the cost of his friend's table.

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.305
Damn it. He's so chill.

00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:25.985
He was like, "Here's the credit card."

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.745
And then he took out more cash
from his wallet

00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:31.545
and handed it to the waiter.

00:12:34.945 --> 00:12:36.825
Damn.

00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:39.665
What do I have to do to be rich like him?

00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:42.985
Give me free money.

00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.025
-Can you go home by yourself?
-Of course.

00:12:46.105 --> 00:12:47.305
Of course.

00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:49.185
-I definitely can.
-Hey.

00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:53.425
Guys, how are y'all getting home?

00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:55.705
I'll call a cab.

00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:00.265
What about you?

00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:03.465
Taxi.

00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:09.505
What about you, Thi?

00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.385
Waiting for Thorn, right?

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.825
That's right.

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:16.385
I'll be waiting outside.

00:13:16.825 --> 00:13:18.865
It's too loud inside.

00:13:18.945 --> 00:13:19.985
Yeah.

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:22.905
Get home safe.

00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:24.865
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:29.785
-Goodbye.
-Thank you so much, bro!

00:13:30.105 --> 00:13:32.345
Bro. What about me?

00:13:33.665 --> 00:13:34.665
See you then.

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:37.465
Thi.

00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:38.745
Huh?

00:13:38.825 --> 00:13:40.145
Where's my money?

00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.505
Yo, let's go home.

00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:53.945
Hey.

00:13:55.225 --> 00:13:57.825
-Will you be able to drive?
-Of course.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:00.705
Can you drive when you're this drunk?

00:14:01.265 --> 00:14:03.225
Yeah, I do it all the time.

00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:07.745
Stay here, I'll call the driver.

00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:10.065
No.

00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:12.265
Let go of me.

00:14:33.265 --> 00:14:34.465
Turn off the engine.

00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:41.305
San, turn off the engine.

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:17.145
Damn it!

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:20.945
I fucked up! I can do nothing!

00:15:21.745 --> 00:15:24.185
San, what's wrong? Why are you crying?

00:15:24.265 --> 00:15:26.385
There's nothing I can do.

00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:30.265
What are you talking about?

00:15:32.905 --> 00:15:35.665
There's nothing I can do.

00:15:41.385 --> 00:15:43.025
There's really nothing I can do.

00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:46.145
I can do nothing.

00:15:57.585 --> 00:15:59.025
I can't…

00:16:26.745 --> 00:16:27.865
Thank you.

00:16:39.345 --> 00:16:40.785
Please take care of him.

00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:42.985
All right. Don't worry.

00:17:09.184 --> 00:17:11.505
Everyone! Hey! Thorn! Thorn!

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:12.905
Everyone!

00:17:13.305 --> 00:17:14.184
Come see this!

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.825
-What is it?
-Bro, come here.

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:30.545
What I just told you,
only use it when you really need to.

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:33.225
You got it?

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.505
Non.

00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:10.545
I…

00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:13.705
I have something to tell you.

00:18:18.025 --> 00:18:19.105
What is it?

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:22.705
It's about your mom.

00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:34.545
What happened?

00:18:37.385 --> 00:18:39.065
Thi called us to check something.

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:40.545
Just now.

00:18:59.585 --> 00:19:01.225
Thi, pause it.

00:19:02.945 --> 00:19:03.785
Mook…

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:05.545
was that Aunty Jit?

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.465
Hey.

00:19:08.385 --> 00:19:10.985
-That's really her.
-You guys know her?

00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:13.825
She's our faculty's janitor.

00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:17.385
-But why is she…
-Here's the thing.

00:19:18.585 --> 00:19:23.105
We now know that they will stick together
and they have a pack leader.

00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:27.265
But the question is…

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.465
Why does it to have to be her?

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:32.825
Why Aunty Jit?

00:19:33.745 --> 00:19:35.105
What makes her more special?

00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:37.985
That's all you want to know?

00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:39.745
Such fucking nonsense.

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:42.505
Hey. Thorn! If you're stupid, shut up.

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:47.105
Maybe you see nothing, but I do.
Stop thinking that I'm a fool.

00:19:49.665 --> 00:19:50.505
Thi…

00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:54.585
This is important.
It's a matter of life and death for us.

00:20:06.865 --> 00:20:07.865
Nan.

00:20:13.105 --> 00:20:15.665
Do any of you know
why they roar like that?

00:20:16.545 --> 00:20:18.145
I mean, nothing happened to her.

00:20:25.545 --> 00:20:28.905
It's like she cried
because her friend got eaten.

00:20:28.985 --> 00:20:29.905
Her friend?

00:20:32.585 --> 00:20:35.185
Then why didn't the others
see her as a friend?

00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.105
She was the only one who cried.

00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:42.065
And why didn't Aunty Jit
eat those corpses that they brought?

00:20:42.745 --> 00:20:44.865
Why eat her and not the others?

00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:51.145
Here.

00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:53.705
This is the climax.

00:21:01.065 --> 00:21:03.665
She sacrificed her food
for the entire group.

00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:06.905
She got just one in return.

00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:09.065
Why this behavior?

00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:13.705
For real, does this sound
like nonsense to you?

00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:18.025
If we can't find the answer,
all we can do is keep running

00:21:18.425 --> 00:21:21.745
and miss the chance to survive,
and become one of them.

00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:58.305
Come on, where is it?

00:22:03.265 --> 00:22:04.105
Ning.

00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:05.825
Yeah?

00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:07.385
Check this out.

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:22.425
Where did you find it?

00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:26.065
Wiroj's drawer.

00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:39.625
NONNTHAKAN
8 JULY 2003

00:22:41.305 --> 00:22:42.305
Why…

00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:47.065
Why did Wiroj
have a picture of my mom and Non?

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:53.865
The code for the safe
is six digits, right?

00:22:55.585 --> 00:22:56.665
That's right.

00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:04.305
Why don't we try this?

00:23:07.145 --> 00:23:08.265
Are you crazy?

00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:10.745
Are you kidding me?

00:23:10.865 --> 00:23:15.025
How could my brother's birthday
be the code to his safe?

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.665
There's no harm trying.

00:24:31.385 --> 00:24:35.185
The one that cried when Nan got eaten
is the zombie that bit her.

00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:47.545
What do you mean?

00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:54.985
She was the one who made Nan a zombie.

00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:59.825
I know that.
But what does it matter? Why the roar?

00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:09.345
I think they stick together,
kind of like they're related.

00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:17.345
It's like an extended family.

00:25:18.385 --> 00:25:22.625
So when a zombie turns another person
into a zombie,

00:25:23.185 --> 00:25:25.225
they form an emotional bond.

00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:27.145
It's passed on from one to the other.

00:25:29.985 --> 00:25:30.985
Just like…

00:25:31.985 --> 00:25:36.745
humans or some animals
have bonds with their family…

00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:39.865
between parents and their child…

00:25:40.745 --> 00:25:42.705
or bonds between siblings and relatives.

00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:47.545
So they're like a mother and child?

00:25:48.705 --> 00:25:51.825
That's what I think.
I can't imagine it any other way.

00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:56.225
But…

00:25:56.865 --> 00:26:00.825
if they cry for another reason,
I have no idea what it is.

00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:12.305
Wait.

00:26:13.785 --> 00:26:15.265
If you're right…

00:26:17.665 --> 00:26:19.945
it means Aunty Jit
is everyone's mom, right?

00:26:20.905 --> 00:26:21.745
No.

00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:26.305
Aunty Jit could be
their great-grandparent.

00:26:28.185 --> 00:26:31.185
To summarize,
they all have a bond with Aunty Jit.

00:26:33.545 --> 00:26:34.585
What the fuck?

00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:37.905
Then Aunty Jit has a mom, too,
doesn't she?

00:26:37.985 --> 00:26:39.105
Not necessarily.

00:26:39.505 --> 00:26:42.745
And why not?
How could she have gotten infected?

00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:48.425
This is going way too far.
I'm not buying this idea.

00:26:51.185 --> 00:26:54.185
What if she got directly infected?

00:26:55.825 --> 00:26:59.545
Then it means that there wasn't
another zombie before Aunty Jit.

00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:00.705
Am I right?

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:04.945
Directly infected?

00:27:05.665 --> 00:27:06.665
But how?

00:27:07.985 --> 00:27:09.785
What faculty did she work in?

00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:27.145
That's what I was talking about.

00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:21.585
What project is this?

00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:29.025
-Ning!
-Huh?

00:29:29.105 --> 00:29:29.945
I found it.

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:42.145
VOLUNTEER PROFILE
FOR SERUM PROJECT

00:29:49.785 --> 00:29:53.385
FUTURE BLOOD SAMPLE RESEARCH
CONSENT FORM

00:29:55.305 --> 00:29:56.825
Letter of consent.

00:29:59.745 --> 00:30:01.345
Anti-aging test.

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.065
What the hell?

00:30:16.425 --> 00:30:17.945
This so fucking cruel.

00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:21.065
How the hell could he do this?

00:30:23.225 --> 00:30:26.105
He deceived these people
and used the contract as cover.

00:30:26.185 --> 00:30:28.225
And it has no legal validity at all.

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:47.065
No way.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.305
Mook, keep your voice down.

00:30:51.185 --> 00:30:52.505
Don't you get it?

00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:56.185
Killing Aunty Jit
is like killing their parent.

00:30:56.265 --> 00:30:58.385
If you were them, what would you do?

00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:02.025
What about everything we said?

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:04.705
There's nothing we can do about it.

00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:08.385
Isn't that true? Isn't that true?

00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:10.945
Yeah.

00:31:13.345 --> 00:31:14.945
Now there's nothing we can do…

00:31:17.385 --> 00:31:21.505
because what we know so far
still doesn't answer a lot of questions.

00:31:21.905 --> 00:31:25.585
Like why did Aunty Jit have to eat Nan?
Why not the other zombies?

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:30.825
When zombies eat their prey,
are they really eating them?

00:31:31.545 --> 00:31:33.705
Or just trying
to keep their species going?

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.825
Why do they act like they're going
back to work like when they were alive?

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:47.025
Is it a fixed action pattern,
like in animals?

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.585
Or is there something more?

00:31:51.105 --> 00:31:53.785
And what's that swelling on their neck?

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:56.465
We still have no idea about these things.

00:31:56.945 --> 00:32:00.345
But if you have to know everything
before you do anything,

00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:02.065
will you ever have enough time?

00:32:05.425 --> 00:32:09.265
We'll use what we know to our advantage.

00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:12.105
And what we know now…

00:32:13.825 --> 00:32:17.065
is that the zombies
have the same weakness that we do.

00:32:18.185 --> 00:32:19.265
And what's that?

00:32:25.065 --> 00:32:26.705
Caring about others.

00:32:37.185 --> 00:32:38.785
What if we don't kill it?

00:32:43.945 --> 00:32:45.585
What if we bring it in alive?

00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:08.425
Would they dare do anything
to the person who brought a knife?

00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:41.585
You go around and get the gun.

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:45.105
Then shoot his head.

00:33:45.985 --> 00:33:47.345
What about you?

00:33:48.105 --> 00:33:51.665
I'll go and distract it.

00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:37.185
You little shit, you've gone blind.

00:34:44.425 --> 00:34:45.585
Aek!

00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:49.145
Aek!

00:34:50.225 --> 00:34:51.344
Aek!

00:34:55.465 --> 00:34:56.304
Aek!

00:35:17.225 --> 00:35:18.585
Jean!

00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:24.065
Shoot!

00:35:24.785 --> 00:35:29.905
Shoot now! Come closer!
Shoot it right to his head!

00:35:29.985 --> 00:35:32.665
Get closer and shoot it! Hurry up!

00:35:46.625 --> 00:35:47.785
You sit here first.

00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:51.665
And close your eyes.

00:35:52.345 --> 00:35:53.425
Take off your clothes.

00:36:05.985 --> 00:36:07.145
No, don't touch it!

00:36:08.145 --> 00:36:09.585
Don't use your hand yet.

00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:22.145
If they really are parasites,
their blood is very dangerous.

00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:26.265
When Gus was infected,
it might have been because that axe.

00:36:36.545 --> 00:36:37.825
Can I open my eyes?

00:36:53.185 --> 00:36:55.785
I'll do it myself. Get some rest.

00:37:31.505 --> 00:37:32.585
It's a parasite.

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:37.745
Aek got infected before he shot himself.

00:37:39.785 --> 00:37:43.625
Does that parasite
turn people into zombies?

00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:03.545
We have no place to run to.

00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:15.385
Hello.

00:38:16.465 --> 00:38:17.985
My name is Wiroj Limmanapong.

00:38:19.825 --> 00:38:23.625
Head of the Department of Biological
Innovation Research and Development.

00:38:23.705 --> 00:38:25.865
Kiatpipat University of Innovation.

00:38:32.825 --> 00:38:35.945
I record this video as my confession

00:38:37.145 --> 00:38:40.865
because of a serious incident
caused by the serum I created.

00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:44.345
I can't yet say what the serious
incident is.

00:38:45.985 --> 00:38:48.465
But because of the mistake
that was made today…

00:38:50.185 --> 00:38:52.625
innocent people may lose their lives.

00:38:54.385 --> 00:38:56.945
To anyone who gets this video,

00:38:58.825 --> 00:39:02.385
be careful using my confession as proof.

00:39:04.105 --> 00:39:09.025
It could end up hurting you
or someone you care about.

00:39:10.585 --> 00:39:13.425
Everything I'm going to say
from now on is true.

00:39:16.065 --> 00:39:19.025
All of this began with a project
called Anisong.

00:39:20.945 --> 00:39:23.185
I'm not saying
they will turn into humans again.

00:39:23.265 --> 00:39:24.905
No one would dare to assume that.

00:39:25.465 --> 00:39:28.785
But you once said
that they are like people who sleepwalk.

00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:29.865
Yes.

00:39:30.385 --> 00:39:31.865
Like they're sleeping.

00:39:32.305 --> 00:39:35.825
I think all the routines they do
are some kind of reflex.

00:39:36.425 --> 00:39:38.345
And the rain and the temperature

00:39:38.425 --> 00:39:40.345
have something to do with this behavior.

00:39:40.865 --> 00:39:44.225
That means Aunty Jit
will do her routine, too.

00:39:44.825 --> 00:39:46.905
If we need to do something with her,

00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:49.465
we need to go
to the science faculty's janitor room.

00:39:49.545 --> 00:39:50.905
Wait, wait, wait.

00:39:52.025 --> 00:39:53.985
Isn't this idea a little too crazy?

00:39:54.065 --> 00:39:55.745
Killing her might be easier.

00:39:56.225 --> 00:39:58.865
One wrong move,
and it's over for all of us.

00:40:00.145 --> 00:40:03.625
For me, all of our ideas are crazy.

00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:06.185
But we figure things out
with what we know.

00:40:06.265 --> 00:40:09.785
And killing their mother
will have more negative consequences.

00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:15.145
But to catch her alive,
even if it's hard or impossible,

00:40:15.745 --> 00:40:17.945
will give us more opportunity.

00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:21.105
What opportunity?

00:40:21.985 --> 00:40:24.105
We couldn't take her hostage,

00:40:24.865 --> 00:40:27.785
but we've got the first group
of infected zombies.

00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:31.185
And we also have a biologist with us.

00:40:32.385 --> 00:40:34.105
Whatever is inside Aunty Jit…

00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:39.385
it might answer the questions
that we have about them.

00:40:40.185 --> 00:40:43.665
I think what we still don't know
is the way out.

00:40:45.905 --> 00:40:47.145
Let's vote.

00:40:50.465 --> 00:40:53.105
Anyone not in agreement, raise your hand.

00:40:59.465 --> 00:41:00.625
It's settled then.

00:41:01.745 --> 00:41:03.025
Let's plan this.

00:41:06.625 --> 00:41:08.545
Our time runs out at sunrise.

00:41:44.865 --> 00:41:45.905
Castor bean.

00:41:49.505 --> 00:41:50.665
Blackboard tree.

00:41:53.385 --> 00:41:54.465
Psilocybe mushroom.

00:41:55.745 --> 00:41:57.985
What next? What next?

00:41:58.505 --> 00:42:01.385
A gun! Gun! Yes, I need to find a gun.

00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:05.545
Where's a gun? Gun, gun… Oh!

00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:07.985
You scared me.

00:42:08.745 --> 00:42:09.785
What gun?

00:42:11.345 --> 00:42:12.625
A gun that…

00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:17.785
Just a gun. A gun for shooting these.

00:42:18.705 --> 00:42:19.865
Shoot what?

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:23.145
Shoot zombies.

00:42:28.985 --> 00:42:30.025
Castor bean?

00:42:31.425 --> 00:42:32.545
Yeah.

00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:35.305
It's ricin, a substance
extracted from castor beans.

00:42:35.385 --> 00:42:36.865
Have you watched Breaking Bad?

00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:39.625
Yeah, what about it?

00:42:41.505 --> 00:42:43.025
Jesse's cigarette.

00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:46.065
Oh!

00:42:46.705 --> 00:42:47.745
Damn!

00:42:48.545 --> 00:42:50.385
Just 0.2 milligram.

00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:53.185
It's twice as potent as cobra venom.

00:42:53.545 --> 00:42:56.185
It's the most dangerous poison
derived from a plant.

00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:59.785
-And currently, there is no antidote.
-Okay, I got it.

00:42:59.865 --> 00:43:02.545
You want a gun to inject this
into the zombies

00:43:03.225 --> 00:43:04.145
That's right.

00:43:04.225 --> 00:43:06.265
Looking at Lily's symptoms,

00:43:06.345 --> 00:43:09.105
they likely absorb plant toxins
much faster than humans.

00:43:13.465 --> 00:43:15.465
But it's still just a hypothesis.

00:43:15.985 --> 00:43:18.625
It might not be every substance
that they react to.

00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:23.105
We need to find a gun that can shoot
at least four to five meters.

00:43:23.705 --> 00:43:25.345
Or else it will be useless.

00:43:26.345 --> 00:43:27.465
What about this?

00:43:38.145 --> 00:43:39.665
Why didn't I think of this?

00:43:40.705 --> 00:43:44.185
There are a lot more over there,
but we'll need more hands.

00:43:45.905 --> 00:43:47.025
Let's go.

00:43:55.145 --> 00:43:56.625
What the hell am I doing?

00:43:57.385 --> 00:43:59.065
-Ready?
-Yes, sir!

00:43:59.145 --> 00:44:00.545
-Ready?
-Yes, sir!

00:44:00.625 --> 00:44:01.865
-Ready?
-Yes, sir!

00:44:02.425 --> 00:44:04.585
-Are you ready?
-Yes!

00:44:04.665 --> 00:44:06.065
Three, four!

00:44:06.145 --> 00:44:10.545
Kiatpipat. The name Kiatpipat is grace.

00:44:10.625 --> 00:44:15.625
Renowned across the heavens,
a mind of wisdom and a heart of virtue.

00:44:16.785 --> 00:44:21.105
Nurturing people alongside wisdom

00:44:21.185 --> 00:44:26.665
with honor and dignity,
your name echoes far and wide.

00:44:27.945 --> 00:44:32.545
In blue and gold,
radiant lights that guide the way.

00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:36.105
As the darkness
of ignorance is vanquished,

00:44:36.185 --> 00:44:38.945
enlightenment brings radiant delight.

00:44:39.025 --> 00:44:44.105
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

00:44:44.665 --> 00:44:49.225
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

00:44:49.305 --> 00:44:52.105
We're Kiat's people, willing to sacrifice,

00:44:52.185 --> 00:44:55.865
to shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

00:44:57.305 --> 00:44:58.345
Lily.

00:45:01.425 --> 00:45:02.385
Lily.

00:45:03.905 --> 00:45:05.145
Lily!

00:45:12.065 --> 00:45:13.585
Three, four!

00:45:13.985 --> 00:45:18.385
The name Kiatpipat is grace.

00:45:19.505 --> 00:45:23.785
Renowned across the heavens,
a mind of wisdom and a heart of virtue.

00:45:24.945 --> 00:45:29.505
Nurturing people alongside wisdom,

00:45:29.585 --> 00:45:34.905
with honor and dignity,
your name echoes far and wide.

00:45:36.065 --> 00:45:40.385
In blue and gold,
radiant lights that guide the way.

00:45:40.465 --> 00:45:41.985
Come back to us!

00:45:42.065 --> 00:45:44.185
As the darkness
of ignorance is vanquished,

00:45:44.265 --> 00:45:46.385
enlightenment brings radiant delight.

00:45:46.465 --> 00:45:47.305
Lily.

00:45:47.785 --> 00:45:52.025
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

00:45:53.025 --> 00:45:56.865
We're Kiat's people,
and we're proud to be.

00:45:56.945 --> 00:45:58.745
-We're Kiat's people--
-Shit!

00:45:59.505 --> 00:46:01.825
-Everyone! Stop it now!
-To shed blood--

00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:03.425
-I said stop!
-Huh?

00:46:03.505 --> 00:46:04.505
Look at that!

00:46:06.825 --> 00:46:10.345
-Shut the fuck up. Stay silent.
-We fucked up.

00:46:18.425 --> 00:46:19.705
Oh, my! Shit!

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:23.025
We really fucked up.

00:46:26.505 --> 00:46:31.425
We're Kiat's people, willing to sacrifice,
to shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

00:46:33.745 --> 00:46:34.625
Shit.

00:46:35.065 --> 00:46:35.945
Damn, Lily.

00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:42.025
We're Kiat's people, willing to sacrifice,
to shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:45.505
Oh, my gosh.

00:46:47.945 --> 00:46:49.065
Look.

00:46:50.785 --> 00:46:54.185
To shed blood and flesh for Thailand.

00:47:14.265 --> 00:47:16.065
Dedicate…

00:47:16.145 --> 00:47:16.985
Lily.

00:47:17.065 --> 00:47:19.385
Dedicate…

00:47:19.465 --> 00:47:20.985
Lily, stop it, Lily.

00:47:22.305 --> 00:47:24.305
-We'll all die.
-She's not gonna stop.

00:47:24.745 --> 00:47:26.305
She led them to us.

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:29.905
Dedicate…

00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:31.225
We will die for sure.

00:47:31.305 --> 00:47:34.465
Dedicate…

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:38.665
Why are Kiatpipat cheerleaders the best?
Answer me!

00:47:38.745 --> 00:47:41.545
-Because our choreography is the oldest.
-No!

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:44.385
-It's about our accuracy!
-Still no!

00:47:44.465 --> 00:47:46.545
Run ten laps around the field!

00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:48.985
-We want to help our friends!
-No!

00:47:49.065 --> 00:47:50.065
Answer me again!

00:47:50.145 --> 00:47:52.465
Why are Kiatpipat cheerleaders the best?

00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:55.465
Because we love each other so much!

00:47:58.985 --> 00:48:01.705
Dedicate…

00:48:03.825 --> 00:48:05.025
Dedicate…

00:48:08.745 --> 00:48:09.585
Lily.

00:48:17.425 --> 00:48:18.865
I'll go out and bait them.

00:48:18.945 --> 00:48:20.345
No way.

00:48:20.425 --> 00:48:22.185
-Sun.
-Huh?

00:48:22.265 --> 00:48:23.265
No way.

00:48:23.345 --> 00:48:24.505
If I don't do this…

00:48:25.585 --> 00:48:26.985
none of you will survive.

00:48:29.505 --> 00:48:30.345
Sun!

00:48:30.945 --> 00:48:31.985
You're not going.

00:48:33.265 --> 00:48:35.505
If you go, we'll go with you.

00:48:38.185 --> 00:48:39.705
Bring them outside.

00:48:40.665 --> 00:48:42.665
And meet your brother at the gym.

00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:46.665
What about Lily?

00:48:51.225 --> 00:48:52.425
Let her go.

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:56.465
Both her time and mine are up.

00:48:59.705 --> 00:49:01.385
Now it's your time.

00:49:05.585 --> 00:49:09.545
I'm giving the mentor position
to both of you.

00:49:16.025 --> 00:49:17.145
Sun.

00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:20.385
I love the two of you.

00:49:22.145 --> 00:49:23.145
I love you, too.

00:49:24.225 --> 00:49:25.545
We love each other.

00:49:31.705 --> 00:49:33.505
No! Sun, no!

00:49:33.585 --> 00:49:35.705
Sun! Sun!

00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:39.825
Sun!

00:49:39.905 --> 00:49:41.465
-No.
-Sun!

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:43.225
-Sun!
-Sun!

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:46.105
Sun, don't do this!

00:49:54.745 --> 00:49:56.265
Sun, please forgive me.
