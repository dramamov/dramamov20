(Two months later)

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:36.759
How is my sister?

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:38.640
Her Highness is fine.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.200
She's merely suffered some shock.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:43.439
I'll prepare some
calming medicine for her.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.439
She'll recover.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:45.479
However...

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.880
What's up?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240
Her pulse is smooth and bead-like.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:51.479
This indicates

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.439
she's pregnant.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.000
Good! Excellent!

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.239
Ji.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.840
Zhiying,

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.760
slow down.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.239
Zhiying,

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.040
you've done well.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.920
Carrying the royal heir is a great joy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.879
We'll celebrate well.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.760
I'll become an uncle.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.480
I'll make sure everyone

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.959
knows of this joyous occasion!

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.439
Why aren't you happy, Zhiying?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.200
Are you exhausted?

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.120
Get some rest first.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.439
Leave the rest

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to me,

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.159
okay?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.359
Notify the head maid immediately.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.239
Begin preparations at once

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.640
for the celebration banquet.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.480
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.960
Cheng Ge,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.520
I'll surely find

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.360
the antidote.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.039
If you can eliminate Gao Ji,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.560
and reclaim power sooner,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.639
it will fulfill my greatest wish.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.759
In that case,

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.360
even if I were to die...

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.719
Stop nonsense!

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.960
I won't let you die.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.159
Now

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.719
Shi Nan has lost the Empress
as his pawn,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.599
getting the imperial seal

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.560
depends solely on us now.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.439
But as long as the poison

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800
remains in your body,

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.680
I won't have peace of mind.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.360
By the way,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.680
I forgot to ask.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.039
That day

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.719
in the Empress's chamber,

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.080
what exactly happened

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.199
that changed her nature so suddenly?

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.800
That's a long story.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.639
Her Grace's pregnancy

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.159
calls for nationwide celebration!

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.520
Cheng Ge, I...

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.800
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.599
This is truly wonderful news!

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.800
I'll host a grand feast today

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.319
to bless you and Her Grace.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.680
I'll invite all envoys to celebrate.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.360
Let's go.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.000
Accompany me to visit Her Grace

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.319
and your firstborn.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.759
Well...

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.360
I heard His Majesty will stay
with Her Grace tonight.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.199
She carries the royal heir now.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.360
Why is this surprising?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.360
True.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.199
(Why should I care
about such trivial matters?)

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.000
(With my parents unavenged)

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.360
(and Gao Ji still alive,)

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.079
(what's the use of love?)

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.199
Work faster, all of you!

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.920
Clear all these items out!

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.920
If anything harms the royal heir,

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:31.720
can you handle it?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.600
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.000
Move it there.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:42.480
Your Highness.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.360
Zhiying,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.399
this is your favorite kite.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.519
Look, I brought it here.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.240
I'll leave it here for you.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.040
Your Majesty.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.360
Tonight, Her Grace
and my precious nephew

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.920
are in your care.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:20.480
Alright.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.040
All of you, leave now.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.759
Don't disturb Her Grace
and the royal heir's rest.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.759
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.480
It was inconvenient

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:34.959
with Gao Ji here.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.279
Zhiying,

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.920
the child...

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.839
What truly happened to you out there?

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:50.600
Stop asking.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.759
(Now that the Empress has an heir,)

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.560
(Shi Yu's predicament)

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.800
(would get worse.)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.079
(Once the heir is born,)

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.879
(Gao Ji will surely eliminate him.)

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.759
(Then it'll be too late.)

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.120
(But if Shi Yu never
got close to the Empress,)

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.759
(how did she have the child?)

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.879
(The Empress was disheveled.)

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.360
(Could it be)

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.439
(that this child is...)

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.279
Why are you back?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.720
The Empress refused to talk.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.160
Where are you

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:05.319
heading?

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.560
They said

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.600
you stayed in the Empress's chamber.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.319
I was coming to find you.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.959
Cheng Ge,

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.639
I never shared a bed with her.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.480
I love you. I could never
get close to another one.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.120
I trust you completely.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:27.879
I came to find you

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.399
specifically to tell you

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.079
that her child...

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.439
Now that the Empress has fled,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.560
what should we do?

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:42.240
As long as we hold the antidote,

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.600
they'll have to bring
the imperial seal back to me.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.920
It's just a matter of time.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:51.399
Why rush?

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.639
But grabbing Gao Zhiying wasn't in vain.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.160
I enjoyed being with her.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.240
What do you mean?

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:01.199
I think Gao Ji has gone too far.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.920
I got back at the Empress.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.319
Master.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.199
Get out!

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.120
Yes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.879
Congratulations, my lord.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.799
Thank you.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:54.840
Thank you all.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.399
My family will achieve greatness

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.440
under my leadership.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.399
Even the future Emperor

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:03.480
will carry the bloodline
of the Gao family.

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:05.799
I

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:07.759
can finally face

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:10.080
our ancestors with pride.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.519
Greetings, Your Grace.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.240
What's wrong?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.879
Ji,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.440
I need to talk to you.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.759
Shouldn't you be resting at the palace?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.159
Why do you come here?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.639
Dismiss everyone first.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.879
Gentlemen.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.080
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:57.320
What happened?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.679
What's going on?

00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.879
Ji,

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.879
this child isn't His Majesty's.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.080
What did you say?

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.879
Who else knows about this?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.679
Who's the father

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.440
of the child?

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:38.600
Gao Zhiying!

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:45.039
Have I been too lenient with you?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.200
If this child were Shi Yu's,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.000
you know what it would mean

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.200
for our family.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.679
Yet you've acted this way.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.799
How dare you shame our family?
