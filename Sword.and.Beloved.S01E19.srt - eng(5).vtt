[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.610
[Episode 19]

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.430
Pass a message to Madam Yin for me.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.280
Tell her

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.820
I need her help
finding out where Young Master Fugui is.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.509
There must be something wrong
with the Qianji City.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.310
Qingcheng seems to be
taking good care of me,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.320
but actually,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.840
he's locked me up and deprived me

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.680
of freedom.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.710
I need to get out of here
as soon as possible

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.310
and find Young Master Fugui.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.240
Come on, mind your hands.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840
Good boy.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.680
Sir.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.910
I'm already drawing the second one.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.310
Let me see.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.030
Well done.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.079
Hello.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.840
I heard
the fish lanterns you sell are amazing.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.540
Even the strongest wind
can't blow them out.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.240
My dad is a porter.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.630
Sometimes he has to deliver goods
to a faraway place.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.540
It's super windy at night.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.520
I want to get him a lantern

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.190
so that Dad can come back home early.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.470
Okay.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.480
Then give me a moment.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.430
Okay.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.120
I drew this, too.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.750
Look.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.400
Is this one okay?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.910
Yes.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.680
Wow.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.600
But I have nothing to pay you.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.579
Not even a sweet potato.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.530
It doesn't matter.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.680
I think your bouquet is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.960
so beautiful.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.750
Can you give it to me?

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.910
Can this really do?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.030
Of course.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.240
Thank you, sir.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.030
Bye.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.030
Bye.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.680
In the Sandstorm Town
of the Western Regions,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.610
I sell paper lanterns for a living.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.180
I call myself Wang.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.360
They call me Lantern Wang.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.190
As I've been
living a plain life since childhood,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.190
I don't need much.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.960
So it's not hard

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.840
to get by.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.280
I thought this simple life

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.430
would calm me down.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.820
But somehow,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.580
when night falls

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.850
and I see the light in every household,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.910
my heart

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.000
also flickers with them.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.430
My mind drifts back to the days

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.120
in the Huadeng Village.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360
They were simple,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.560
delightful,

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.040
full of bliss

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.070
and company.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.430
At dusk every day,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.920
I'll try to restore some inner power

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.450
to ensure that I can survive normally

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.120
rather than rely on others.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.830
But deep down inside, I know

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.480
the real reason why I do this.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.370
Although I care about Qingtong's safety,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.480
I'm also aware

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.080
that potential threats still loom large
in the Western Regions.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.640
And restricted by this binding spell,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.170
I can only keep my longing

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.310
to myself.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.640
The first priority now is

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.540
to find out where the Water-Control Orb is

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.210
and figure out a solution.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.070
Recently,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
an uninvited guest came to my house.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.600
A corsac fox.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.930
You must be hungry.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.920
As a corsac fox with strong demon power,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.870
you should've been able
to transform into a human.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.040
You came to my place

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.560
because of this pot of daisies, right?

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.120
What?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.770
You don't like the food?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.980
Stop howling.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.950
I don't have meat at home.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.080
Just make do with it.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.290
I thought
it was just asking for some food.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.890
But because I refused to feed it meat,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.310
it's now holding a grudge against me

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.510
and sticking around.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.280
Sir,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.560
pick whatever you like.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.310
I have the best meat.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.950
I don't want meat

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.270
for myself.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.070
Which piece

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.800
is the freshest?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.510
This...

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.090
This one.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.630
Please get me three catties.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.240
Okay.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.250
Have you heard that?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.680
The royal corsac fox family is

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.480
looking for the Second Prince,
who's been missing.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.600
It's been years,
and they never looked for him.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.680
Can they find him now?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.510
Who knows?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.570
The Second Prince?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.920
Could it be

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.750
him?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.450
[Corsac Fox State]

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.480
Still no news about Yunfei?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.720
[Fan Yuanji, the Corsac Fox Emperor
of the Western Regions]

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.520
Your Majesty,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.970
if you keep worrying like this,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.190
you're going to crash out.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.240
[Imperial Preceptor
of the Corsac Fox State, Western Regions]

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.170
You should at least eat something.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.120
At my age,

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:47.070
the only thing I can't let go of

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.310
is chopsticks.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.560
Give it a try.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.400
Your Majesty!

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.070
Your Majesty,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.930
we've found clues
about where the Second Prince is.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.600
Send troops there now.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.270
Yes.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.290
What is it this time?

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.320
I need garlic.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.700
I forgot it.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.910
Are you from the Thousand Silk Cave?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.230
You mean

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.030
my sister summoned you

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.400
and asked you
to find out where the Soldier is?

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.230
As you can see,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.020
my sister is back with me.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.320
Tell Madam Yin

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.510
that from today onwards,
the Silk Cave and Qianji City

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.000
had better not interfere with each other.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.160
I-I will pass on the message.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.160
Don't move!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.360
Is the Soldier

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.410
of the Yiqi Alliance alive or dead?

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.030
He's still alive,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.840
yet with his sword meridian cut off,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.700
his power lost,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.360
and himself
exiled to the Western Regions.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.840
The Western Regions?

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.720
Will you tell my sister

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.270
that the Soldier is still alive?

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:49.810
No,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.180
I will never tell her.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.480
Please trust me.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.290
Qingcheng,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.750
why did you

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.570
dress me up in such a fancy way?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.410
Sister, you know what?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.270
This is the scene

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.130
I've been dreaming of many times.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120
I even carefully

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.870
decorated this room for you.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.340
Do you like it, Sister?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.530
Qingcheng,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.600
you should first tell me

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.440
how you became like this.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.750
And what's going on

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.870
with this Qianli City?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.150
Looks like you've finally started
to care about me, Sister.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.240
In your heart,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.240
I'm never your only one.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.080
But I won't forget

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.400
every word you said.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.590
Everything about you

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.910
matters so much to me.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.180
Sister, do you know

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.080
what kind of monster

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.810
the former Qianji City Lord is?

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.280
[The Former Qianji City Lord]

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.320
He was cruel

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.540
and bloodthirsty.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.360
He hunted demons
and absorbed their demon power

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.030
to boost his own strength.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.000
That day, he captured all the demons

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.530
in the Deer Village
to absorb the demon power.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.390
I was

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.910
one of them.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.240
I've absorbed all his demon power.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.790
Yet he's still alive.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.360
What an excellent body.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.030
Hush.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.080
Don't move.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.440
Let's continue the game.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.120
This is called

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.850
the Bone-Refining Demonic Gu.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.110
It will

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.880
make your body strong

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.720
and unbreakable.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.880
Qingcheng,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.390
how did you break free from him?

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.760
What else could I do?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.600
I killed him.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.030
As for how I did it,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.630
I'll tell you later.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.270
Qingcheng,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.310
I'm sorry.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.990
I failed to well protect you.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.290
I'm sorry.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.550
Sister.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.670
I know

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.690
that the Soldier is very important to you.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.750
But I still hope

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.550
you can give me a share
of your love for the Soldier,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.580
even if it's just a little.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.340
I've sent people to look for the Soldier.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.740
I hope you can understand

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.310
that no matter what you want to do,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.240
this Qianji City

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.360
will always have your back.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.240
Sister,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.720
have a good rest.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.750
Did you find him?

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.320
No, no.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.380
What about you?

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:07.780
We didn't find them.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.470
What should we do now?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.640
We'll probably be sentenced to death.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.170
Over there.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.150
Look!

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.960
Keep your voice down.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.690
Keep it down.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.080
Okay.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.250
Let's go.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.030
Go.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.790
Let's go.

Take your valuable possessions

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.600
and come with me.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:15.920
Where...

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.260
Where are we going?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.790
I, the Boss,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.750
am a heroine.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.750
Due to some luck recently,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.910
I got an incredible magic tool.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.370
So I've decided

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:27.880
[Female Bandit from the Western Regions]

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.810
to rob the rich and help the people.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.200
A magic tool?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.900
Could it be that the Water-Control Orb is
in her hands?

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.030
Is there anyone who wants to follow me?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.960
Is she asking for money or food?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.790
Does she

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.730
want money or grain?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.790
Is she asking for grain?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.150
I don't get what she means.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.870
No idea.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.440
Ignorance is so scary.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.750
I mean,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.910
I'll take

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.570
your money.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.950
I want the strong guys, too.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.120
If you volunteer to join us,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800
you will suffer less.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.660
Do you understand?

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.200
You fierce woman!

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.120
The Sandstorm Town is

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.650
in the charge of the Li Army.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.050
How dare you plunder it?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.840
-Yeah.
-That's right.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.390
The Li Army won't let you go!

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.480
It's so hard to reason with you.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.660
What are you doing?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.320
Let go of me! Let go!

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.240
Stop it.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.960
What did you say?

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.390
You guys went

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.050
a bit too far, don't you think?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.720
Interesting.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.960
Da.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.720
Yes.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.340
Take him with us.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.910
Yes.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.910
That's good.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.240
I can go with them to find out
where the Water-Control Orb is.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.440
[Corsac Fox State]

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.359
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.810
I only used a little knockout incense.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.000
Prince Yunfei

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.569
will wake up soon.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.550
We forcibly transformed him
into a human with the talisman.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.680
He will be mad for sure when he wakes up.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.849
Don't be afraid.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.109
Do you remember

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.420
the play I taught you?

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.430
Yes.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.440
He'll wake up soon.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.080
Very soon.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.270
Yunfei.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.460
Don't run!

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.030
It's me, your father.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.360
Don't be scared, Yunfei.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.790
I've had a hard time looking for you.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.960
Can you tell me

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.680
why you've been wandering outside

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.680
without transforming into a human?

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.480
Yunfei,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.450
since you don't want to tell me,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.160
I'll just take a guess.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.420
Yunfei, the person you've liked the most

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.810
since childhood is

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.190
the owner of that pot of daisies,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.680
your brother Yunhai, isn't it?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.480
Yunhai is my first son.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.230
He was good-looking,

[Fan Yunhai, the Eldest Prince
of Corsac Fox State, Western Regions]

powerful,

gentle, and modest.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.640
After you were born,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.930
you kept sticking around him..

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.680
Maybe because

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.640
of his mother's lowly background,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.830
Yunhai liked to keep wild flowers.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.730
Before you were born,

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.400
I had only one son.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.510
I honestly planned
to pass the throne to him.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.100
But you are my first heir,

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.670
the son of the Queen.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.270
I don't

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.980
care about that.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.640
My brother was the best person.

You all

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.520
treated him unfairly.

Yunfei,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.110
did you hear about the news

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.480
that your brother
would go guard the sand cave?

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.300

before the Queen passed away,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.170
her biggest wish was

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.860
to send you to guard the sand cave.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.520
You know why, right?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.730
Yes.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.000
Yunfei,

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.070
I'm leaving.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.520
I've always known

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.290
that you could have transformed
into a human long ago.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.000
Am I right?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.130
You're afraid that your existence

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.290
might make me lose everything.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.420
That's why you refuse to transform.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.640
Right?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.070
Silly boy.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.370
There are things

that you can't

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.270
change easily.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.510
That's fine.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480
From now on,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200
Yunfei, you don't

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.080
have to always let me get the upper hand.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.110
So,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.730
you ran away from the imperial palace
for the sake of Yunhai?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.240
You haven't come back even once
for so many years, right?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.350
I did come back

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.780
on the day my brother passed away.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.880
It's all my fault for being useless.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.640
It's not your fault.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.830
I heard

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.550
that he got backstabbed.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.790
So he

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.750
chose to take the enemy down with him.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.960
It's all because

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.110
I was so old and dumb

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.880
that I couldn't even protect my son.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.340
Now that your brother is gone,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.880
and you refuse to come back,

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.590
I'm the only one left,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.270
long in tooth, living all alone.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.070
If your brother Yunhai were still alive,

feel heartbroken for me.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.310
that from today on,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.560
you're the only prince
of the Corsac Fox State.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.090
On your wedding day,

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.640
you'll
succeed to the throne automatically.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.790
Boy,

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.970
you won't be so cruel

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.750
to see your old father

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.420
spend his final days
on the throne, will you?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.350
I

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.070
still have many dreams

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.720
to fulfill.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:21.960
Well...

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.790
Well done!

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.590
The Prince said yes!

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.480
Your Highness, you're so filial

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.890
and agreed so easily!

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.110
No...

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.480
No matter what,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.430
you and your brother are the same,

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.550
both responsible

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.400
and devoted to your family.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.270
I...

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.070
I...

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.200
I understand.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.550
You will surely retrieve
the sacred relic of our clan,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.720
the Water-Control Orb,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.400
right?

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.640
What?

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.270
Orb?

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.270
Prince Yunfei agreed!

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.590
His Highness will go to the enemy's camp

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.640
and take back our clan's sacred relic,
the Water-Control Orb!

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.000
The Corsac Fox Clan will achieve
great rejuvenation!

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.440
Bring back the sacred relic

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.750
for the great rejuvenation!

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.030
Bring back the sacred relic

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.270
for the great rejuvenation!

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:01.590
Bring back...

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.070
Stop.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.030
I only said

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.130
five words in total.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.390
I'm counting.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.990
But it doesn't matter
how many words you said.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.400
According to reliable sources,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.070
the sacred relic

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.030
fell into the hands
of a fierce female bandit.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.510
Your Highness,
as wise and powerful as you are,

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.240
it'll be a piece of cake for you.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.030
Boy,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.400
you've grown up.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.120
It's time to shoulder responsibilities.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.160
I'll leave this

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.510
to you.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.450
Imperial Preceptor,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.550
is the braised camel meat ready?

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.000
Oh, right.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.440
Can't cook it for too long.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.200
Braised camel meat

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.550
won't taste good if overcooked.

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.030
Yes.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.160
That's why

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.890
I didn't want

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.860
to transform into a human.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.880
General Li Xueyang is here.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.540
General Li!

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.440
General Li,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.550
you must help us.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.680
General Li.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.400
Please help us!

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.310
Did they leave anything behind?

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.640
The female bandit didn't leave anything.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.240
This is her subordinate's belt.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.030
Taling talisman!

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.920
Thank you, General Li.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.200
Thank you, General.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.920
Thank you, General.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.570
I'm leaving first.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.110
Wait for my locating signal.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.670
Yes!

Giddy-up!

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.480
Yunfei,

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.110
I know you want to break in

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.160
and take back the Water-Control Orb.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.760
But that is

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.960
a waste of your beauty.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.640
What is the principle
of our Corsac Fox State?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.110
Rather stay alive kneeling

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.170
than die standing.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.210
Slyness and deceit are what

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.110
keep the fox spirit lasting forever.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.440
Slyness is

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.270
our nature.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.110
Why act so recklessly?

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:15.920
Go.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.910

Stop there.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.350
Stop.

from the nearby village.

Bring him in.

Go over there.

It's me, that poor dog.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.510
You all lied to me.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.670
I'll kill you.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.710
I'll kill all of you.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.480
My sister belongs to me!

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.280
That's right.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.320
Let me take over

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.030
the last part of your nirvana.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.490
As long as my sister can stay,

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.070
what's the big deal about telling a lie?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.630
Your sister is not a fool.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.030
Your little trick

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.590
can't keep your sister

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.190
by your side forever.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.920
Then I'll do whatever it takes

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.150
to cut off every way she could leave me.
