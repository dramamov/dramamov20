(People's Police)

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.900
You released Ma Weicheng?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.580
The case isn't solved yet.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.460
We haven't found the body, Chief Chen.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.900
Ma Weicheng insists

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.740
that on that night,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.060
the suitcase he threw into the sea

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.300
didn't contain a body

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.860
but some old clothes he didn't want.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.990
Who dumps clothes into the sea

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.990
at midnight?

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.150
Do you believe that?

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.470
I don't.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.860
Chief Liu, tell me:

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300
What charge did we use
to arrest Ma Weicheng?

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.060
Murder. The murder of Qin Hong.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.300
But Qin Hong is still alive.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.610
Yeah, I know she's alive.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.060
But it might be Zhang Yan who died.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.350
Where's the evidence?

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.860
You've got nothing concrete.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.590
Is that why you released the suspect?

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.260
Ma Weicheng's lawyer somehow

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.500
got word that Qin Hong is still alive,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.030
so they press us to release him.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.260
The higher-ups also asked

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.710
about what charge

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.060
we've been holding him under.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.940
What else could I do?

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.660
Chief Chen,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.620
I just have one request.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.620
Please send someone

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.460
to keep an eye on Ma Weicheng.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.030
Chief Liu, don't worry.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.710
I've arranged surveillance.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.260
Our priority now is

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.180
to push Lyu Danshun harder.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.180
Only he can help us

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.030
uncover the truth now.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.260
Officer,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.820
I've explained everything.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.500
I didn't kill anyone.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.820
If you don't believe me,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.020
why keep asking the same thing?

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.180
She framed me

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.500
for fraud.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.300
Have you examined the body carefully?

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.550
Come on.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.940
Lyu Danshun is determined to hide this.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.820
What can we do?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.140
I'd never seen a dead person before.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.500
I was really scared.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.380
What are you looking for?

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.710
Do you know this person?

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.820
No.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.710
Ma Weicheng...

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.990
What about her?

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.700
He's been locked up for so long.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.800
He didn't change his statement before.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.240
Why change it now?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.590
Her name is Zhang Yan.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.710
Are you suggesting

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.940
that he might've noticed something

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.620
during the last interrogation?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.710
I get it now.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.620
Get what exactly?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.620
What do you mean?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.590
She set me up.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.710
Could it be

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.620
because I asked him about Zhang Yan?

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.820
So, he suddenly realized

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.490
the victim was Zhang Yan.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.060
He figured out Qin Hong wasn't dead,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.310
so the murder charge doesn't hold.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.300
Could he tell
it was Zhang Yan who died?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.660
Exactly.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.260
How did he realize the one
who died was Zhang Yan?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.550
Unless

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.180
his relationship with Zhang Yan

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.620
isn't what he told us it was.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.820
In our past investigations,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.180
we always focused on the victim.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.300
Everything revolved around the motive.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.060
Maybe this case is the opposite.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.180
Maybe the key lies
with the killer instead.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.120
Do you remember the first time we went

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.360
to the crime scene?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.860
I found it really strange.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.180
The evidence was almost so perfect

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.620
that it felt staged.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.590
If all of this was meant

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.260
to frame Ma Weicheng,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.740
everything would make sense.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.710
You just reminded me of something.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.380
When we were in Chang'an Town,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.590
I saw a drawing by Zhang Yan's daughter.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.550
Let's say

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.830
the one with long hair is Zhang Yan.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.620
What if the short-haired one
in the dress

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.190
is Qin Hong?

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.470
From the painting,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.190
they seemed really close.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.830
Officer Liu, I admit it.
Hong and I used to be close.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.070
But I've moved on with my life now.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.960
There's nothing between us anymore.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.470
Qin Hong is dead.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.470
Have you figured out Kaifu's case?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.830
Zhao Chen, the driver,

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.590
confessed that Huang Shuquan

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.540
had ordered him to kill Kaifu.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.710
But it was too late.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.910
Danshun,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.430
I came today

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.830
to apologize to you.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.070
Back then, you blamed me

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.270
for not finding out the truth
about Zhao Kaifu's death.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.710
So, Qin Hong committed murder.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.540
I've always remembered that.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.110
So, about this case today,

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.710
I don't want

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.710
my inadequate investigation

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.780
to mislead everyone again,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.530
getting farther from the truth.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.790
Danshun,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.070
only by telling the truth

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.830
can you actually help Qin Hong.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.430
Of course,

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.830
I'm not here

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.830
to talk to you about Qin Hong today.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.950
I want to talk about someone else.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.190
Ma Weicheng.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.710
Do you know Ma Weicheng?

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.550
No.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.830
He's been released on bail.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.220
Why?

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.070
Why?

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.070
Ma Weicheng was arrested
for killing Qin Hong.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.950
But Qin Hong is still alive.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.310
We suspect the one who died
was Zhang Yan,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.540
but we never found her body.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.190
And you refuse to admit

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.070
that she's dead.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.780
So, the case doesn't hold up.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.470
We had to release Ma Weicheng.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.710
You can't let him go!

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.070
Why not?

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.590
He's a killer! That's why!

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.710
How do you know he's a killer?

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.470
Who did Ma Weicheng kill?

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.190
Say it.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.230
Ma Weicheng killed Zhang Yan.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.110
Ma Weicheng killed Zhang Yan?

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.710
You were her boyfriend.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.830
Why didn't you call the police?

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.230
Not only did you keep quiet,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.990
but you even let Qin Hong
take Zhang Yan's identity.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.660
Do you know
what all the evidence points to?

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.950
Qin Hong and you conspired
to kill Zhang Yan

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.780
and framed the innocent Ma Weicheng!

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.350
Isn't that exactly what I said?

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.660
Because you found out Zhang Yan
was a fraud.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.990
She was not a fraud.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.190
Zhang Yan wasn't a fraud.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.310
She's the kindest person
I've ever known!

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.830
I knew about her past from the start.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:47.660
So what?

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.310
I have a past, too.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.870
I didn't tell her from the start

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.000
why I came to Pingtan

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.590
and why I chose to stay.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.210
We just followed what love led us to.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.570
And that brought us together.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.270
Who is it?

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.070
It's urgent. Let me take this call.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.830
Hello?

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.500
It's me.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.470
I'm in Pingtan.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.590
Is my package still with you?

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.190
Is it damaged?

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.230
It's untouched.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.950
When will you come for it?

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.470
When are you free?

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.830
I'm free anytime.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.310
Then let's do it now.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.190
I'll send you the address.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.150
Okay.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.070
What happened?

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.190
A friend of mine ran into some trouble.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.470
I need to go check on her.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.290
You can go back to sleep.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.950
Hong?

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:26.890
Hong?

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.470
Danshun.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.990
Hong.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.190
Come home with me.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.630
Did you bring my stuff?

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.790
Yes.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.230
Here, take it.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.670
I can't let you help me for nothing.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.260
I didn't help you for this.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.340
You're out here alone.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.230
Money always makes things easier.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.470
Hong.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.710
What's your plan from now on?

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.940
What will you do?

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.190
Are you trying to go abroad?

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.470
I've been in Pingtan for a year.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.370
I know the place well.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.850
I can handle things that you can't.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.690
Danshun,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.990
I have to do some things alone.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.390
Stop following me.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.870
It draws too much attention.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.710
For the two of us,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.910
it's just not convenient.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.100
Boss, she's here.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.430
Did you bring the money?

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.020
Is this route safe?

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.950
My way is definitely safe.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.740
Boss, look at the money.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.190
Grab her; don't let her get away!

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.030
Stop running!

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.910
Stay right there!

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.030
- Don't run!
- Stop!

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.710
Don't run!

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.230
- Don't run!
- Stop!

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.190
Bring her back to me!

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:53.590
Hong.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.550
Hop on.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.710
- Stop!
- Don't run!

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Catch her!

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:13.780
You've been following me?

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.540
I couldn't just leave you alone.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.430
When I first left Chencang,

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.430
I thought I'd get here in no time.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.290
I didn't expect this at all.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.540
In the past year,

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.340
so much has happened.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.570
But I've learned something important.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.740
Apart from myself,

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.230
I shouldn't trust anyone.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.990
So, don't blame me
for being cautious with you.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.020
Before I met you that day,
I was thinking:

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.470
If Danshun betrayed me,

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.950
what would I do?

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.230
If that happened, it wouldn't be so bad.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.470
I wouldn't have to keep running.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.540
I'm just so tired.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.190
Come home with me.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:56.670
Don't joke around.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.190
What home?

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.710
Look at you.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.950
You must've started a new life.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.990
Since you've got a fresh start,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.190
make the most of it.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.910
Don't let my mess hold you back anymore.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.950
I've got a girlfriend now.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.710
Finally, someone wants you.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.100
She's got a daughter.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.020
She's really kind.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.790
That's nice.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.710
That's why

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.190
I can't be a burden to you three.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.780
At least

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.710
one of us deserves

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:54.950
to be happy.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.230
If I don't say anything,
she won't find out.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.630
I'll tell her you're my cousin
here for business.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.780
I've thought it all through.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.670
Why can't we just go our separate ways?

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.430
You've done so much for me.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.780
I'm really grateful for that.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.340
When my dad beat me nearly to death,

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.340
didn't you step in anyway?

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.710
That was different.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.550
Hong.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.150
If you don't want to drag me into this,

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.710
then come home with me.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.710
I'll help you go abroad.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.780
The sooner I get you out,
the better I'll feel.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.190
Then I'm staying with you.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.180
If you're in trouble,
I'm in trouble, too.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.230
I'm Qin Hong.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.710
What's your name?

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.150
I'm Lyu Danshun.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.910
This is my cousin, Lin Chang.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.190
This is my girlfriend, Zhang Yan.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.180
Nice to meet you.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.570
Nice to meet you, too.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.710
My cousin came here for business.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.710
But she ran into a fraud,

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.340
so she's staying with us for a few days.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.430
Chang,

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.970
I'll change your bed sheets and cover.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.230
Just leave them there;
I'll do it myself.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.150
Thanks.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.340
Okay.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.870
This room is a bit small.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.120
It used to be Mengmeng's room.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.600
You'll have to make do for now.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.670
I'm happy to have a place to sleep.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:03.780
Sorry for the trouble.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.550
No worries.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.190
If I take Mengmeng's room,

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.190
Mengmeng

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.470
won't mind, will she?

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.470
Of course not.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.390
Chang.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.780
I heard from Danshun

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.430
that you came here for business.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.910
What kind of business?

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.270
Clothing.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.100
How nice.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.910
Danshun said you're
a few years older than him.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.780
So, you must be married already?

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.100
I am.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.710
My husband

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.180
passed away.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.840
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.670
It's all in the past now.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.670
Chang, you're still young.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.870
Have you thought
about finding someone new?

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.550
No.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.570
I've never thought about it.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.100
Nor do I want to.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.230
What about you?

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.150
When did Danshun and you meet?

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.190
It's been a year and 28 days.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.670
How precise.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.310
That's sweet.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.150
My silly cousin is always lucky.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.150
He found a pretty
and thoughtful girlfriend.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.780
I think I'm the lucky one here.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.740
I have a kid.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.390
He never minds that.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.780
I just think if we can

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.190
just live our days well,

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.470
I'd be more than content.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.550
Alright.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.430
I'll head out then.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:02.630
I won't disturb your rest.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.540
Stop right there!

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.580
Don't run!

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.430
Mom.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.100
Auntie, why are you wearing
Mom's clothes?

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.870
Yeah.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.430
Your mom lent them to me.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.870
Where did Mom and Uncle go?

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.430
They went to work.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.910
Work?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.990
What are you drawing?

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.630
I'm drawing Mom, Uncle, and myself.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.230
That's really good.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.230
What's this?

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.190
It's a ring.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.710
Why aren't you wearing it on your hand?

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.950
Because it's the wrong size.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.260
Auntie.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.870
I need to go to the restroom.

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.470
Do you need me to help you?

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.020
Here.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.270
Your mom is here.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.220
- Mengmeng's mom.
- Thanks.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.060
Alright.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.540
Let's go, Mengmeng.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.220
Let's go pick up Uncle Danshun
from work.

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:51.500
How about this?

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.950
I'll help you look.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.150
Don't worry.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:56.830
Let me check again.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.540
Everyone is saying
it's the fishing ban season.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.470
So, no way to go.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.620
Then what to do?

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.350
I can't stay here forever.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.570
It's not convenient like this.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.230
You...

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.470
You're back.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.620
Mengmeng is back, too.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.870
Mom and I went to your workplace.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.140
They said you didn't go to work.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.660
I had something to do this afternoon.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.020
A friend asked me for a favor.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.100
Which toy do you want?

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.950
I want the bunny.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.390
Chang?

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.180
(Name: Qin Hong)

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.700
(Name: Qin Hong)

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.500
Chang.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.220
I'm finding a toy for Mengmeng.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.380
(Wanted Notice: Qin Hong)

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.350
Where have you been
taking Mengmeng lately?

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.430
I couldn't reach you at all.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.910
I was so worried.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.780
(Wanted Notice: Qin Hong)

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:20.790
When I first met you,

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.140
I knew you had some money.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.570
Even when things were toughest,
you never touched that money.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.010
So, I figured it must be

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.370
really important to you.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.830
It belongs to her, right?

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.990
There are things
I've never asked you about.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.470
Because I felt if you wanted me to know,

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.540
you'd tell me yourself.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.310
But you never did.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.470
Hong has watched me grow up.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.370
I've always seen her as my real sister.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.620
Before she ran away, she told me

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.980
she'd come to Pingtan to go abroad,

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.660
asking me to bring the money here first.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.580
We were supposed to meet
two months later.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.620
Time passed, and she never showed up.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.540
That's when I met you.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.350
I never meant to keep it from you.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.350
I just wanted you all to be safe.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.820
But I'm scared
that if cops found us one day

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.960
and started asking questions,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.430
they'd say you covered for Hong.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.390
If I kept it from you,

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.750
you wouldn't be dragged into this.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.660
But she's a murderer.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.430
You told her everything.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.450
Weren't you afraid Zhang Yan
would call the police?

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:03.870
I decided to understand

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.140
and accept

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.370
whatever choice she made.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.500
From the very start, I owed her that.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.020
So, that day,

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.430
did Zhang Yan come back with you?

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.060
Both Hong and I thought

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.270
she would never come back,

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.620
and it'd be our last meeting.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.470
Hong felt guilty about it.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.870
She decided to leave that very day.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.140
But Zhang Yan came back.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.430
And her reaction

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.540
was nothing like what Hong
and I imagined.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.870
I'd like to talk to you.
