00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.460
Your Majesty.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.699
Xin'er.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.860
You're here.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.819
Your Majesty.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.619
I heard you had a headache,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.739
so I had the Imperial Kitchen

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.580
prepare your favorite
glutinous rice cakes.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.620
Are you feeling better now,
Your Majesty?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.219
The moment I saw you,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.980
my headache went away.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.780
It's strange, isn't it?

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.019
Could it be

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.940
that you have some sort of magic?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.940
Your Majesty, you jest.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.539
Try them.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.380
These glutinous rice cakes
have always been your favorite treat.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.059
They bring back

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.820
a lot of memories from my youth.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.340
I used to bring them
to Lord Wing often.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.539
I'm sure

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.819
His Lordship loved the taste as well.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.140
Of course.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.840
Once, right after finishing the rice cakes,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.160
Lord Wing got so excited and
he ran all over the Imperial Garden.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.340
We couldn't catch up with him.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.099
All that excitement

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.659
over some glutinous rice cakes?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.220
Yes,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.060
these really were that good back then.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.219
Doesn't the palace's rice cake

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.060
taste the same?

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.860
It's because
they were made by my mother herself.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
That's the first time
I've heard Your Majesty mention Mother.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.740
Um...

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.980
What was she like?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.380
She was the best person in the world.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.140
But often, the kindest ones
are the ones who get hurt the most.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.980
Did something happen to her?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.660
You're asking a lot of questions today.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.940
I...

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.779
I merely wish

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.459
to know more about Your Majesty.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.060
You only need to know

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.740
that when Mother was alive,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.940
I was the happiest person on earth.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.340
And now, with you here,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.020
I'm still the happiest.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.779
Indeed.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.939
But Your Majesty,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.820
you're still not fully recovered.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860
Our matters

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.259
can wait.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.819
You're right.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.499
I must take good care of my body.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.779
In the future, I want to have

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.780
many princes with you.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.899
It's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.099
getting late.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.059
Your Majesty must rest well.
I will come to see you again tomorrow.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.180
Very well.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.219
Your Majesty.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.219
Why not just capture that demon?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.700
It's best to observe her first.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.940
After all, she is the Empress now.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.419
We know she's a demon,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.940
but no one else does.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.299
We need

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.500
an adequate reason to dispose of her.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.500
Besides,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.940
she even dared to tamper with my body.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.140
It's only fair that I return the favor.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.860
Someone's had their heart ripped out!

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.099
Guo Gai'er!

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.580
What happened to you, Guo Gai'er?

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.499
His...

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.300
His heart was ripped out!

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.059
Your Highness! It's terrible!

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.179
What's the matter?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.019
Several palace attendants
died last night.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.619
Their hearts were all ripped out.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.140
This morning, someone told His Majesty

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.859
they saw the demon who rips out hearts

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.180
was you in disguise.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.340
His Majesty has summoned you.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.180
Someone must be framing me.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.819
All right.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.220
I'll see who dares to slander me.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.740
Your Majesty.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.980
The Empress is here.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.020
Speak.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.820
Your Majesty.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.579
When the incident happened last night,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.500
I passed by the crime scene

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.059
and saw

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.700
a white fox.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.299
I saw it too.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.659
I followed that fox

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.259
under the cover of darkness
to Her Highness's chambers

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.579
and saw it transform

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.459
into Her Highness's form.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.299
Her Highness is the fox demon.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.540
Nonsense!

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.819
I was with Her Highness all night.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.740
When did she turn into a demon?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.659
Your Majesty, falsely accusing the Empress
is a crime punishable by death.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.260
Knowing and not reporting it is treason!

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.620
Your Majesty.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.620
It was certainly not my doing.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.460
May Your Majesty uphold justice.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.800
So many pairs of eyes saw
Her Highness as the fox demon.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.940
Indeed.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.340
Was it really not you?

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.380
It wasn't me.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.059
If the Empress says she's not,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.860
then she isn't.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.939
Guards,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.419
slap these two servants
who have been spreading lies.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.219
Understood.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.380
- It's an injustice!
- Your Majesty, it's an injustice!

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.780
Your Majesty!

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.420
Your Majesty.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.019
Rushing to clear
Her Highness's suspicion

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.860
seems hasty.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.740
What do you suggest I do?

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.220
Your Majesty.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.339
Maybe this is a misunderstanding.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.459
It might have been
a misperception on their part.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.499
The immediate priority

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.139
is to find the real culprit.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.059
As you wish.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.220
Stop.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.740
Huang Gou'er.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.459
You have two days

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.140
to find who's behind the heart-rippings.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.580
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.420
Take them away.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.619
We saw it!

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.939
We saw it with our own eyes!

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.899
- Your Majesty!
- It's an injustice, Your Majesty!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.019
Please believe us!

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.699
Her Highness really is the fox demon!

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.140
We were wronged, Your Majesty!

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.140
She really is the fox demon!

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.540
Don't be upset.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.780
You mustn't concern yourself
with two servants.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.220
I will investigate

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.940
to find who is committing these crimes
in the palace.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.780
Once caught,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.740
I will have the culprit torn to pieces.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.699
Your Majesty is wise.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.180
(Since the culprit disguised themselves
as a fox to rip out hearts,)

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.059
(they must have left)

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.300
(some clues on the bodies.)

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.620
This wound doesn't look right.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.540
What's wrong?

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.579
These white fox pelts

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.540
all come from old, worn-out skins.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.940
Why is that?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.420
Look here.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.020
At the roots of the fur,
there are no follicles anymore,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.420
and the fur and flesh are dried out.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.340
That shows it fell off old fox pelts.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.700
Look closely.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.659
The edges of this wound
are smooth and neat.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.420
Like the others,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.740
it clearly shows cuts
made by a sharp blade.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.220
Someone must have ripped out the hearts

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.140
and then faked the wounds
using white fox claws

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.979
and worn a white fox pelt

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.420
to make it

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.940
look like the fox demon was responsible.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.859
But why choose a white fox?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.460
And why frame me?

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.620
Could someone know

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.619
I'm a white fox and want to use this

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.140
to get rid of me?

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.140
Could it be my brother?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.140
That's unlikely.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.379
The Charm Spell I placed on him

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.340
should still be effective.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.219
No wonder he cares for you so much.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.660
So that's the reason.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.539
Could it be someone found out

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.540
I'm investigating the Mother-Child Gu

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.340
and want to use this to silence me?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.460
Probably not.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.619
Only I have met Ghost Granny.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.419
Besides,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.200
no one else knows about our connection.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.899
I still think the Gu was embedded in you

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.259
through the glutinous rice cakes
you ate as a child.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.179
Also, yesterday

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.019
I heard from His Majesty

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.790
that the glutinous rice cakes you ate
were all made by the Former Empress.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.460
Do you think

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.940
it was her?

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.740
Unlikely.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.259
I have no grudge
against the Former Empress.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.940
Why would she do that to me?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.459
Forget it.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.499
The urgent priority

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.379
is to find

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.299
the real culprit as soon as possible.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.339
They must be connected

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.580
to whoever planted the Gu.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.819
Your nose is sharper than mine.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.340
Did you smell anything?

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.340
I was about to say.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.259
All the bodies

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.739
have a scent.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.739
It's not demon.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.940
It's human.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.859
And somehow familiar.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.540
I must have smelled it before.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.780
But who exactly?

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.179
Don't rush.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.420
Think carefully.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.620
I really can't remember.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.739
It's all right.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.579
Look.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.019
It's late,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.419
and you've been busy all day.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.740
You must be tired.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.299
Go back and get some sleep.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.739
Maybe you'll remember

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.020
after a good rest.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.860
What happened?

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.059
We saw it!

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.219
We saw it! Her Highness
really is the fox demon!

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.140
Her Highness is the fox demon!

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.420
It's them...

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.740
The heads are indeed here.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.099
They saw your demon form,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.260
so you silenced them, didn't you?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.899
Seize the fox demon!

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.940
Yes.
