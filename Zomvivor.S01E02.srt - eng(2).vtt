00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:12.825
Damn it.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:13.905
Fuck!

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:15.825
What happened?

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.465
Damn it.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.305
If we tell Aek and Kawin

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.505
and just drive off, I think it'll be fine.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:28.105
It can still run, but for how long?

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:31.185
It's a big truck and not very agile.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:33.545
None of the cars here have keyless entry.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.665
They all use push-button ignition.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.825
Why did you turn off the engine?

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:42.705
We have to wait until nighttime.

00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:43.985
Save the fuel.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:46.185
Once we're back here…

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.025
we can just hop on and go.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:04.945
Game…

00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:10.185
Is he going to make it?

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:16.745
Game is your brother.

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:18.305
He's going to make it.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.025
Hey!

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:35.105
Earth! The helicopter is here.

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:36.225
-Let's go!
-Wait.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:37.665
What?

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:40.265
That's not a passenger helicopter.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:43.785
Fuck! What do we do now?

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:47.585
Shit.

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:17.185
Damn it!

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:37.945
Shit!

00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:46.105
Damn.

00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:07.825
Hey…

00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:09.385
Fuck.

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:12.785
Oh, fuck.

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:15.425
Hey!

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:26.505
Come on.

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:30.985
Run!

00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:36.385
Hurry.

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:38.305
Now.

00:08:05.945 --> 00:08:07.225
Non, help!

00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:08.145
It's too much!

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:09.225
Get out!

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:10.265
Shit!

00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:14.145
Why didn't you follow me?

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:15.145
ONE YEAR EARLIER

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:16.145
My phone froze.

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:18.025
No excuses. I saw you run off.

00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:20.905
I said I couldn't fight.
Riktor was camping in the bush.

00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:22.505
If I'd gone in, I'd have died.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.585
Don't blame each other.

00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:26.585
He left me to die, Mom.

00:08:29.065 --> 00:08:29.985
Here.

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.665
Eat up before you go dying again.

00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:33.545
What? Mom!

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:37.425
Mom, my phone froze.

00:08:38.024 --> 00:08:39.144
So I got flamed by her.

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:40.425
Don't you dare.

00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:41.385
Ning!

00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:43.345
Be nice to him. No swearing.

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:46.065
He asked you for a new phone.

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:49.345
-My phone's on its last legs.
-Save up and get it yourself.

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.385
Stop it.

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:51.745
You got yours from San.

00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:57.265
Who did you take it from?

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:01.145
I didn't take it from him.

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:03.185
I bought it off him with my own savings.

00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:05.705
-Do you have your own savings?
-Stop.

00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:10.705
Let me have a look.

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:20.865
When did you buy this?
Where's your old phone?

00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:22.825
Dropped it in a tank at the Marine Lab.

00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:24.385
Why didn't you tell me?

00:09:24.705 --> 00:09:26.465
A phone costs a fortune, Mom.

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:30.145
San has a ton of phones,
so I got one from him for a good price.

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:36.145
I just pretended to be upset at her.

00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:38.625
She really needed a new phone.

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.625
I've got no problem with that.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.905
I was just wondering
why you didn't tell me.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:47.585
All right.

00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:50.385
Finish your food
and go to your class, okay?

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:51.505
I'm off to work.

00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:58.145
Be nice, all right?
Don't be rude to each other.

00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:03.225
By the way, Ning,

00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:05.465
don't forget to hang your clothes.

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:08.265
-Is your class at noon?
-Yes. Bye!

00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:15.225
I'm sorry.

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:17.345
Yeah.

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:19.985
Hang your laundry out to dry, too.

00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:51.465
Morning.

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:53.185
Please take care of this.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:54.505
I'll be back a bit late.

00:10:54.585 --> 00:10:55.465
No problem.

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:56.505
Here.

00:11:08.185 --> 00:11:09.225
Excuse me, Professor.

00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:19.825
All clear.

00:11:21.025 --> 00:11:23.305
Phao, I need your help. Are you available?

00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:24.305
What is it?

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.465
I need two good new phones
with the exact same model.

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:35.065
Have you come up with the speech?

00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:39.545
Yes, I have.

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:41.425
I'll handle it.

00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:43.985
Make sure nothing goes wrong afterward.

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:08.745
San.

00:13:09.465 --> 00:13:10.345
Mom?

00:13:25.025 --> 00:13:26.105
Joe.

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:27.185
Joe!

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.265
Joe.

00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:31.425
-Joe!
-What's with him?

00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:32.545
Joe!

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:33.745
Joe.

00:13:33.825 --> 00:13:34.825
Joe!

00:13:35.465 --> 00:13:36.345
Joe!

00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:38.705
What have you done?

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:44.225
Joe!

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:50.345
Joe's condition has stabilized, sir.

00:13:50.425 --> 00:13:54.185
He passed out due to panic
and the addictive substances in his body.

00:13:54.705 --> 00:13:57.025
We're still waiting for the lab results.

00:13:57.705 --> 00:14:00.545
We're not sure about the Anisong vaccine
Dr. Aom gave Joe

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:02.505
or how it's affecting his body.

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:03.985
How long until it's certain?

00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:09.505
Less than two hours, sir.

00:14:09.585 --> 00:14:10.585
Impossible.

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:12.145
It's too soon.

00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:17.305
What does that mean?

00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:23.505
Your son's not going to die anytime soon,
so don't worry.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.665
Keep tabs on his metabolism

00:14:28.465 --> 00:14:30.385
and cellular respiration.

00:14:30.985 --> 00:14:32.985
That's where the symptom will show up.

00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:36.065
Understood.

00:14:36.145 --> 00:14:39.665
Once Joe has recovered,
what will be the next step?

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.025
Do we discharge him
or keep him in isolation?

00:14:42.105 --> 00:14:44.745
Lock him up. He can't roam around freely.

00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:47.385
"Lock him up," sir?

00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:51.225
Or let him be arrested like everyone else.

00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:56.745
Doctor, please leave.

00:14:56.825 --> 00:14:57.825
Yes, sir.

00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:09.585
How long do you need?

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:14.865
What are you referring to?

00:15:15.585 --> 00:15:17.425
We understand your anger.

00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:20.225
We will give you time.

00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.105
So, how long are you asking for?

00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:27.865
A month?

00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:31.345
Someone died in this incident.

00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:33.985
What are you going to do?

00:15:45.585 --> 00:15:48.865
I cannot continue.
Please find a replacement.

00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:55.385
You cannot let it go, Kanchana?

00:15:57.145 --> 00:15:58.505
I really can't.

00:16:03.705 --> 00:16:05.985
So what's your solution?

00:16:34.265 --> 00:16:36.665
I will inject myself with Anisong,

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:39.705
the same vaccine
your son was injected with.

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:47.105
You're going to let
this project die alongside you?

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:49.665
You gave me no other choice.

00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:52.465
This is my last resort.

00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:55.785
First…

00:16:56.305 --> 00:16:59.145
I can't simply pull out of this project.

00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:01.145
Everybody is aware of the condition.

00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:03.265
If I violate it,

00:17:03.785 --> 00:17:05.505
it will force you

00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:07.665
to take Ning and Non as hostages.

00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:09.505
Second.

00:17:10.265 --> 00:17:11.944
Whether I agree or not,

00:17:12.025 --> 00:17:14.385
you will halt the Anisong project

00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:17.424
and get the research team
to work on the cure

00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:20.464
in case complications arise in Joe's case.

00:17:20.825 --> 00:17:23.865
I cannot keep working on this project
as if nothing happened

00:17:23.944 --> 00:17:26.745
or disobey and put my kids at risk.

00:17:28.945 --> 00:17:30.865
So this is my only option.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:33.625
Yeah.

00:17:34.865 --> 00:17:37.185
We have really reached a dead end.

00:17:40.345 --> 00:17:41.345
Yes.

00:18:19.145 --> 00:18:21.545
Starting tomorrow,
I'll begin developing the cure.

00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:26.025
If Joe develops any complications,
the same will happen to me.

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:31.785
If I fail to develop the cure

00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:33.305
or am too late to do so,

00:18:33.825 --> 00:18:36.425
you'll have no reason to touch my kids.

00:18:36.505 --> 00:18:37.785
What if it works?

00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:43.705
My kids and I will go live overseas
and pass this project back to you.

00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:57.105
Answer this, Kanchana.

00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:00.225
If I look like a villain…

00:19:01.385 --> 00:19:05.265
why don't I just silence you and your kids

00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:08.105
and find a replacement?

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:13.745
Because you won't find anyone
as skilled or easy to control as me.

00:19:14.425 --> 00:19:16.385
Or else you wouldn't have taken me in.

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:23.545
I would like confirmation
of our agreement.

00:19:25.305 --> 00:19:26.305
It's settled.

00:19:27.385 --> 00:19:28.545
If Joe is safe…

00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:31.425
this will be where we part ways.

00:19:33.225 --> 00:19:34.225
Understood.

00:21:09.225 --> 00:21:10.225
Mom.

00:21:12.425 --> 00:21:14.025
Why are you home so late?

00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:16.505
You didn't even answer my phone calls.

00:21:19.865 --> 00:21:23.265
The delivery workers got together
to protest against the company,

00:21:23.345 --> 00:21:24.785
so I joined them.

00:21:26.265 --> 00:21:28.065
How was the protest? Did you win?

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:34.025
Only for now.

00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:37.665
We don't know what tomorrow brings.

00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:47.385
What's this, Mom?

00:21:57.825 --> 00:22:01.145
PRESENT TIME

00:22:10.585 --> 00:22:12.465
AUNTY IANG: GRANDMA'S WAITING FOR YOU.

00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:13.545
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.105
LEFT THE UNIVERSITY? ANSWER ME.

00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:28.225
What are you sketching?

00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:30.865
I don't really know.

00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:35.265
I notice that some zombies
have this part growing out of them.

00:22:35.345 --> 00:22:36.505
Have you seen one?

00:22:42.225 --> 00:22:43.225
Yeah.

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.105
Shit, Non.

00:22:47.785 --> 00:22:49.705
This is actually happening.

00:22:51.305 --> 00:22:52.825
You're not actually excited?

00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:10.705
Fah, enough.

00:23:11.665 --> 00:23:14.025
The signal's gone.
Calling him won't do anything.

00:23:21.385 --> 00:23:23.145
How can you sit here and do nothing?

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:25.905
Don't you guys have parents?

00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:30.345
Why are you just sitting here?
Why aren't you trying to do something?

00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:34.225
-Hey.
-My heart's about to burst.

00:23:34.305 --> 00:23:36.065
My dad is still out there, Lily.

00:23:36.745 --> 00:23:37.905
-Listen!
-What can I do?

00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:39.345
Fah, listen to me.

00:23:39.425 --> 00:23:40.545
Listen to me.

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:42.385
It's much safer out there.

00:23:42.465 --> 00:23:43.585
He's going to be fine.

00:23:43.665 --> 00:23:45.505
My dad has bad legs.

00:23:45.585 --> 00:23:47.665
He can't stay there. I must save him.

00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:49.105
He can look after himself.

00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:51.585
-Your dad knows his stuff.
-How exactly?

00:23:53.785 --> 00:23:55.225
That's easy for you to say…

00:23:56.065 --> 00:23:58.025
because your dad works for the military.

00:23:58.385 --> 00:24:00.345
My dad is just a vendor.

00:24:00.425 --> 00:24:01.945
Who's going to help him?

00:24:02.585 --> 00:24:03.585
Huh?

00:24:03.665 --> 00:24:05.705
Can you save him? Can you come with me?

00:24:06.585 --> 00:24:07.545
-Come with me?
-Go.

00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:08.505
Fah, we'll go.

00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:09.985
-I'll take you.
-Let her go.

00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:11.145
-Prao, easy.
-Go!

00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:12.105
Prao.

00:24:12.185 --> 00:24:13.225
-Save him.
-Easy.

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:14.185
-Easy.
-Let me go!

00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:15.105
-Come on!
-Prao!

00:24:15.185 --> 00:24:16.185
-Find your dad.
-Prao!

00:24:16.265 --> 00:24:17.105
Prao!

00:24:17.185 --> 00:24:18.105
Stop it, Prao.

00:24:18.185 --> 00:24:19.265
-Let's go.
-Don't go.

00:24:19.345 --> 00:24:20.185
Come on!

00:24:20.265 --> 00:24:21.105
Hey, Prao!

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:22.665
-Prao, stop!
-Calm down!

00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:24.105
What the fuck is with you?

00:24:24.185 --> 00:24:26.825
Why do you have to be
so fucking mean, huh?

00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:28.905
-I'm taking her to her dad!
-Calm down.

00:24:28.985 --> 00:24:31.785
She can't stop pacing.
It's giving me a headache!

00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:36.385
I thought you acted like a bitch
to hide your insecurity.

00:24:36.945 --> 00:24:38.945
But you really are just a bitch.

00:24:39.225 --> 00:24:40.345
Lily, calm down.

00:24:41.945 --> 00:24:43.745
You just figured that out now?

00:24:44.305 --> 00:24:46.265
Took you long enough. Just like your dad.

00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:47.665
-Hey…
-Hey, Prao.

00:24:47.745 --> 00:24:49.665
Whoa. You bitch.

00:24:50.705 --> 00:24:52.345
Enough! Enough!

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.265
Come and get it! Come on!

00:24:54.345 --> 00:24:55.785
-That's enough!
-Bring it on!

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:57.265
What is with you two?

00:24:57.345 --> 00:24:59.905
-Enough!
-Did it hurt? It did, didn't it?

00:24:59.985 --> 00:25:02.185
-Prao, stop.
-If that hurt, stay away from me.

00:25:02.265 --> 00:25:03.665
What's the point of fighting?

00:25:03.745 --> 00:25:04.785
Do you want to die?

00:25:04.865 --> 00:25:07.305
Both of you, stay away. Go and sit there.

00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:08.465
Enough, Prao.

00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:13.905
Calm down.

00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:17.225
Come at me if you want.

00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:19.705
Sit down.

00:25:26.785 --> 00:25:27.785
Easy.

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:03.665
See that guy?

00:26:06.105 --> 00:26:07.785
When he was three years old,

00:26:08.185 --> 00:26:09.985
a tsunami claimed his entire family.

00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:11.785
So he has to live with me…

00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:14.785
at the Patron's foundation.

00:26:17.705 --> 00:26:19.025
The Patron's foundation?

00:26:20.985 --> 00:26:21.985
Yeah.

00:26:22.345 --> 00:26:23.745
It's an orphanage.

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:30.305
What have I done?

00:26:32.745 --> 00:26:34.265
People here…

00:26:36.825 --> 00:26:38.425
They want to leave this place.

00:26:45.545 --> 00:26:47.185
I'm so sorry.

00:26:48.345 --> 00:26:49.625
It's okay.

00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:00.185
Thank you.

00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:04.625
When the morning comes…

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:09.345
let's head out quickly, okay?

00:27:24.385 --> 00:27:25.385
Thorn!

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:27.945
Thorn!

00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:29.265
What the hell?

00:27:29.345 --> 00:27:30.705
Come look at this.

00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:34.945
Hey! Don't go. Stay.

00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:46.545
Whoa.

00:27:49.305 --> 00:27:50.665
Non, what's happening?

00:28:01.825 --> 00:28:02.945
What the fuck?

00:28:03.705 --> 00:28:05.105
Where are they heading?

00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:07.185
This is weird.

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:08.585
What?

00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:09.905
They move with purpose.

00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:12.425
-Look.
-What purpose?

00:28:13.065 --> 00:28:14.145
Humans?

00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:16.505
I don't think so.

00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:20.785
They're moving…

00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:24.025
as if they know where to go.

00:28:26.825 --> 00:28:27.945
This is very strange.

00:28:38.025 --> 00:28:38.985
What?

00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:40.865
What is it?

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:43.785
I'm not sure.

00:28:45.585 --> 00:28:47.265
It might not be related to this.

00:28:51.945 --> 00:28:53.145
What is it, Non?

00:28:54.305 --> 00:28:55.505
That's enough.

00:28:55.825 --> 00:28:57.145
Let's get back inside.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:01.585
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:10.625
Hey, science kid.

00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:12.385
Come with me.

00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:24.825
Guys, I have a question.

00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:27.745
Do you think
those bastards are real zombies?

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:28.825
Huh?

00:29:29.425 --> 00:29:30.625
Why are you asking that?

00:29:30.705 --> 00:29:32.785
It's obvious.
What else should we call them?

00:29:34.825 --> 00:29:35.825
They're like…

00:29:38.825 --> 00:29:39.825
Thorn…

00:29:40.465 --> 00:29:42.425
are you referring to Mick and Jane?

00:29:44.745 --> 00:29:46.185
Who are Mick and Jane?

00:29:56.705 --> 00:29:58.145
It's like they share emotions.

00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:00.305
Emotions?

00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:02.305
After they've become zombies?

00:30:02.385 --> 00:30:03.425
Yeah.

00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:05.705
San, you saw them, didn't you?

00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:12.345
They don't look like
the zombies we imagined.

00:30:13.425 --> 00:30:15.065
Everything is so strange.

00:30:16.345 --> 00:30:17.345
They eat us.

00:30:18.665 --> 00:30:21.145
They turn us into one of them. That's it.

00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:24.585
What's the fucking point
of bringing this up?

00:30:24.665 --> 00:30:26.265
Just go and catch some sleep.

00:30:26.745 --> 00:30:28.305
You need energy for tomorrow.

00:30:29.945 --> 00:30:31.105
Wait, San.

00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:34.545
They say our university is Ground Zero.
Aren't we discussing it?

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:35.825
Yeah, he's right.

00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:41.385
Let's get some rest.

00:30:41.945 --> 00:30:43.945
Talking about it changes nothing.

00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:47.945
We must guard the entrance in shifts
in case other survivors show up.

00:30:48.825 --> 00:30:50.545
Phu and I will take care of that.

00:30:51.745 --> 00:30:53.225
You guys go and sleep.

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:24.945
San…

00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:27.945
about what happened back there…

00:31:28.345 --> 00:31:29.465
I'm sorry.

00:31:32.305 --> 00:31:33.465
Yeah.

00:31:33.905 --> 00:31:34.945
It's okay.

00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:37.425
Get some sleep.

00:31:47.345 --> 00:31:49.505
Nobody could take care of her
better than you.

00:31:50.305 --> 00:31:51.625
You know that, don't you?

00:31:57.345 --> 00:31:58.425
If I didn't fall over…

00:31:58.505 --> 00:32:01.225
You carried her
while being chased by a zombie.

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:02.985
How could you not fall over?

00:32:04.105 --> 00:32:05.345
Can you come with me?

00:32:07.145 --> 00:32:08.305
Where?

00:32:11.625 --> 00:32:13.465
Once we get out of here tomorrow…

00:32:17.265 --> 00:32:19.785
can you come with me to see her parents?

00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:23.985
I'll go.

00:32:26.385 --> 00:32:27.385
Night.

00:32:31.585 --> 00:32:33.145
Would Nan be mad at me?

00:32:38.705 --> 00:32:40.585
WHERE ARE YOU? ANSWER THE PHONE.

00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:41.865
I'LL SEND SOMEONE TO YOU.

00:32:41.945 --> 00:32:44.185
I'M SAFE. DON'T WORRY, DAD.

00:32:51.985 --> 00:32:53.025
Lily…

00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:58.065
Still awake?

00:33:02.465 --> 00:33:03.785
I can't sleep.

00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:12.065
You can talk to me, you know?

00:33:14.385 --> 00:33:15.985
Can you give me your hand?

00:34:18.744 --> 00:34:19.865
That's enough.

00:34:22.744 --> 00:34:23.945
No one's coming.

00:34:24.744 --> 00:34:25.985
We're the only survivors.

00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:28.945
Can you guys accept that?

00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:30.465
Huh?

00:34:30.905 --> 00:34:31.865
You can't say that.

00:34:32.985 --> 00:34:36.145
There might be others
who are somewhere safer.

00:34:37.185 --> 00:34:38.705
Wherever that might be,

00:34:38.784 --> 00:34:40.905
at least they haven't lured
the horde to us.

00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:46.425
Split up and find some weapons.
Then come back here.

00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:49.505
We're leaving for the garage at 7 a.m.

00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:53.465
Get going already. Now.

00:34:57.385 --> 00:34:58.825
-Let's go.
-Wait for me, Thorn.

00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:04.225
Jean, come with me.

00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:26.865
What's the matter?

00:35:28.385 --> 00:35:30.105
I know you've got beef with me…

00:35:31.225 --> 00:35:32.545
but is this the right time?

00:35:32.625 --> 00:35:35.545
What do you know about
Ning's research with Professor Wiroj?

00:35:37.785 --> 00:35:39.025
What research?

00:35:40.345 --> 00:35:41.745
She works on dozens of them.

00:35:43.985 --> 00:35:45.345
The one about her mom.

00:35:47.785 --> 00:35:49.305
Did she tell you anything?

00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:50.865
No.

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.305
Why are you asking me?

00:35:56.945 --> 00:35:58.265
What do you know?

00:36:04.105 --> 00:36:06.305
What do you think
her mom is suffering from?

00:36:09.985 --> 00:36:11.025
Oh, shit!

00:36:12.865 --> 00:36:14.065
Shit! Shit!

00:36:14.465 --> 00:36:15.465
Oops.

00:36:16.745 --> 00:36:17.865
I apologize, sir.

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:43.265
Non…

00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:46.585
our house is far away from the district.

00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:48.545
Mom's going to be fine.

00:36:49.385 --> 00:36:50.945
We'll find a way back to her.

00:37:01.465 --> 00:37:05.145
We need something long
to keep our distance from them.

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:06.825
Don't you agree?

00:37:11.945 --> 00:37:13.025
Pao.

00:37:15.185 --> 00:37:16.225
Yes, Mook?

00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.625
Did you hear what I just said?

00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:23.785
You need to snap out of it.

00:37:26.225 --> 00:37:27.785
I know that you feel bad…

00:37:32.425 --> 00:37:34.225
but if you continue being like this,

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:37.345
you won't be able to save anybody.

00:37:38.705 --> 00:37:40.345
Not even yourself.

00:37:48.985 --> 00:37:51.905
Right now, it's just the 14 of us.

00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:56.545
Along the way to the parking garage,
no one knows what will happen.

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:59.145
Someone in the group may need your help.

00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:01.905
It might be your friend Night…

00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.465
your dear brother Jean…

00:38:06.145 --> 00:38:07.945
or even me.

00:38:09.385 --> 00:38:11.385
You understand why I have to be serious?

00:38:12.145 --> 00:38:13.305
Yes, I do, Mook.

00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:21.105
You're so tall. Bend down.

00:38:21.185 --> 00:38:23.625
-Yes?
-Come here.

00:38:27.065 --> 00:38:27.985
Good job.

00:38:31.785 --> 00:38:33.185
Let's get back to the search.

00:38:41.145 --> 00:38:42.545
Anything here we can use?

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.665
A pair of scissors feels useless.

00:38:54.745 --> 00:38:55.665
Win.

00:38:57.025 --> 00:38:59.545
Whoa. Where did you get this?

00:39:04.545 --> 00:39:05.785
No way!

00:39:09.145 --> 00:39:10.065
Well done.

00:39:12.345 --> 00:39:13.345
Hey, Ice!

00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:16.585
His name's Night.

00:39:17.185 --> 00:39:18.625
Come here and check this out.

00:39:19.625 --> 00:39:21.545
No, you guys need to check this out.

00:39:23.385 --> 00:39:24.265
What the hell?

00:39:28.385 --> 00:39:29.425
What?

00:39:33.985 --> 00:39:35.745
The horde has returned.

00:39:52.545 --> 00:39:53.425
Guys…

00:39:57.385 --> 00:39:58.265
Did you hear that?

00:39:59.985 --> 00:40:01.785
It could be the survivors.

00:40:28.785 --> 00:40:30.025
How are they getting in?

00:40:50.385 --> 00:40:51.225
What?

00:40:51.305 --> 00:40:52.305
They…

00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.065
They're coming here to work.

00:40:56.385 --> 00:40:57.225
Huh?

00:40:58.905 --> 00:41:01.225
They're here. Hide. We have to hide.

00:41:24.145 --> 00:41:25.265
We have to tell others.

00:41:26.225 --> 00:41:28.545
If someone bumps into them,
they'll be screwed.

00:41:28.625 --> 00:41:30.265
How? Can we all go together?

00:41:30.345 --> 00:41:32.345
No, we have to split up.

00:41:33.985 --> 00:41:35.585
Thi and I are going together.

00:41:35.665 --> 00:41:38.545
Fah and Lily, you will go together.
Look for Prao's group.

00:41:39.625 --> 00:41:40.985
We need to leave now.

00:41:41.785 --> 00:41:43.665
If you can't make it back to the hall,

00:41:43.745 --> 00:41:45.145
head to the parking garage.

00:41:45.225 --> 00:41:46.305
Okay?

00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:47.825
What if we can't find anybody?

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:49.505
Just leave.

00:42:07.505 --> 00:42:08.705
What the fuck?

00:42:40.345 --> 00:42:41.185
Non!

00:42:59.905 --> 00:43:01.425
Hey. It's almost 7 a.m.

00:43:01.945 --> 00:43:03.865
It's time. Let's go.

00:43:07.265 --> 00:43:08.225
Thorn!

00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:09.785
What the hell? You scared me.

00:43:09.865 --> 00:43:11.545
-Keep it down.
-Why?

00:43:11.625 --> 00:43:12.985
We can't return to the hall.

00:43:13.705 --> 00:43:14.665
Why not?

00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:16.905
They're in the building!

00:43:18.265 --> 00:43:19.825
-Huh?
-The zombies?

00:43:20.305 --> 00:43:21.385
Yeah.

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:23.945
They opened the doors
and walked in. I saw them.

00:43:24.025 --> 00:43:26.505
How many of them? Why are they here?

00:43:26.585 --> 00:43:29.265
It doesn't matter. Get to the garage.

00:43:29.625 --> 00:43:30.985
No, what about the others?

00:43:31.825 --> 00:43:32.825
Jean…

00:43:33.265 --> 00:43:36.185
Phu is looking for Ning.
Lily and Fah are after Win's group.

00:43:36.265 --> 00:43:37.105
We have to leave.

00:43:37.185 --> 00:43:38.585
We'll regroup at the back.

00:43:38.665 --> 00:43:39.785
-Let's go.
-Hurry!

00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:05.025
What?

00:44:05.105 --> 00:44:06.105
A zombie.

00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:07.065
Where?

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:08.185
At the counter.

00:44:10.305 --> 00:44:13.065
Come here. Come on! This way!

00:44:17.945 --> 00:44:18.945
Shit.

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.545
Night, why is she mopping the floor?

00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:31.865
What do we do, Lily?

00:45:34.705 --> 00:45:35.585
We have to leave.

00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:37.025
-Huh?
-We need to go.

00:45:37.385 --> 00:45:38.465
-Are you sure?
-Go!

00:45:56.505 --> 00:45:59.305
I'll climb down first.
You go after me, okay?

00:45:59.385 --> 00:46:00.425
Okay.

00:46:04.465 --> 00:46:05.465
Be careful.

00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.305
Fah, it's your turn.

00:48:09.505 --> 00:48:10.505
Go!

00:48:41.905 --> 00:48:42.905
What's happening?

00:48:44.065 --> 00:48:45.545
They're all gone. Come on.

00:49:22.665 --> 00:49:23.665
Lily!

00:49:29.185 --> 00:49:30.225
Fah!

00:49:37.305 --> 00:49:38.305
Fah, run away!

00:49:38.385 --> 00:49:39.425
Go!

00:49:41.305 --> 00:49:42.305
Lily!

00:50:12.225 --> 00:50:13.225
Hurry!

00:50:14.145 --> 00:50:15.025
Hey!

00:50:15.105 --> 00:50:16.505
Jean's group is over there!

00:50:16.585 --> 00:50:17.585
-Hey!
-Huh?

00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:24.465
Hey!

00:50:24.545 --> 00:50:25.425
Huh?

00:50:27.785 --> 00:50:28.705
Fah!

00:50:29.305 --> 00:50:30.945
Fah! Come on!

00:50:31.025 --> 00:50:32.225
-Fah!
-Hurry!

00:50:33.425 --> 00:50:34.705
Fah, this way!

00:50:35.865 --> 00:50:37.345
-Hurry, Fah!
-Fah!

00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:38.305
Come on!

00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:39.265
Go, go!

00:50:39.345 --> 00:50:40.225
Take her.

00:50:40.305 --> 00:50:41.385
Go! I'll join soon!

00:50:48.425 --> 00:50:49.545
Move it!

00:51:04.105 --> 00:51:05.105
Lily.

00:51:06.305 --> 00:51:07.305
Lily!

00:51:07.945 --> 00:51:08.945
Lily!

00:51:09.425 --> 00:51:10.545
Get up!

00:51:11.225 --> 00:51:12.105
Lily!

00:51:12.865 --> 00:51:13.785
Lily.

00:51:13.865 --> 00:51:15.265
Can you hear me?

00:51:17.585 --> 00:51:18.785
Get up, Lily!

00:51:20.065 --> 00:51:21.065
-Win.
-Come on!

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:22.305
Win, enough!

00:51:22.905 --> 00:51:23.865
She's gone.

00:51:23.945 --> 00:51:25.065
-We need to go.
-No!

00:51:26.225 --> 00:51:27.265
Lily.

00:51:27.345 --> 00:51:28.745
Wake up.

00:51:28.825 --> 00:51:30.265
Don't fucking leave me!

00:51:30.345 --> 00:51:31.545
Wake up, Lily!

00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:33.065
Lily!

00:51:33.145 --> 00:51:34.145
Please, Lily!

00:51:36.185 --> 00:51:37.505
Don't leave me.

00:51:37.585 --> 00:51:38.745
Lily.

00:51:39.225 --> 00:51:40.225
Lily…

00:51:40.305 --> 00:51:41.625
Get up and talk to me.

00:51:42.505 --> 00:51:44.265
Lily. Lily!

00:51:48.985 --> 00:51:50.825
Win. No, Win.

00:51:50.905 --> 00:51:52.665
-No!
-Let go of me!

00:51:52.745 --> 00:51:54.265
We can't, Win! She's infected.

00:51:54.665 --> 00:51:56.385
She's gone. Look.

00:51:56.665 --> 00:51:59.305
Look at her neck. Step back.

00:52:45.105 --> 00:52:45.945
Go!

00:52:46.025 --> 00:52:46.865
Quick!

00:52:46.945 --> 00:52:47.865
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

00:52:47.945 --> 00:52:48.945
Come on!

00:52:49.585 --> 00:52:50.425
This way!

00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:51.625
-Hurry!
-Faster!

00:52:51.705 --> 00:52:52.665
Oh, fuck!

00:52:53.145 --> 00:52:54.105
Prao?

00:52:54.185 --> 00:52:55.545
Hurry! Hurry!

00:52:57.145 --> 00:52:58.025
Come on! Faster!

00:52:58.105 --> 00:52:58.945
-Quick!
-Hurry!

00:52:59.025 --> 00:53:00.065
-Upstairs!
-Hurry!

00:53:00.145 --> 00:53:01.025
Hurry!

00:53:01.105 --> 00:53:02.105
Go!

00:53:21.505 --> 00:53:22.505
Be careful!

00:53:29.345 --> 00:53:30.745
We just have to go.

00:53:30.825 --> 00:53:32.625
One, two,

00:53:32.705 --> 00:53:33.785
and run! Go!

00:53:34.745 --> 00:53:35.825
Hurry!

00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:43.225
Take the other stairs!
We can't go this way!

00:53:43.305 --> 00:53:44.265
Go!

00:53:44.345 --> 00:53:45.185
-Go!
-Come on!

00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:46.345
-Go!
-Non, come on!

00:53:46.425 --> 00:53:47.265
Just go!

00:53:47.345 --> 00:53:48.305
Go! Go!

00:53:48.385 --> 00:53:49.505
Now!

00:53:49.585 --> 00:53:50.425
Run!

00:53:50.505 --> 00:53:51.545
Fuck you!

00:53:56.825 --> 00:53:57.865
Shit!

00:53:59.025 --> 00:54:00.145
We have to go now!

00:54:00.225 --> 00:54:01.065
Wait, Prao.

00:54:01.145 --> 00:54:03.225
Go without me. I'll join you soon!

00:54:09.425 --> 00:54:11.545
Fah! Fucking run! Run!

00:54:12.465 --> 00:54:13.505
What are you doing?

00:54:13.585 --> 00:54:14.665
Fah, run!

00:54:15.825 --> 00:54:16.665
Fah!

00:54:16.745 --> 00:54:17.745
Go!

00:54:18.425 --> 00:54:19.385
Fah, you need to go!

00:54:20.385 --> 00:54:21.465
Whoa!

00:54:22.305 --> 00:54:23.185
Hey!

00:54:23.265 --> 00:54:24.545
Fah! Fah!

00:54:30.425 --> 00:54:31.305
Fah!

00:54:31.385 --> 00:54:32.225
Pao!

00:54:32.305 --> 00:54:33.145
Pao!

00:54:33.225 --> 00:54:34.225
Run away, Fah!

00:54:36.145 --> 00:54:37.785
Fah! Fah!

00:54:39.665 --> 00:54:40.745
Fah!

00:54:50.185 --> 00:54:51.025
Fah!

00:54:51.585 --> 00:54:52.705
-Fah!
-Pao!

00:54:52.785 --> 00:54:53.705
Fah!

00:55:09.545 --> 00:55:10.425
Hurry.

00:55:10.505 --> 00:55:12.505
This way. Come on.

00:55:15.025 --> 00:55:16.025
Come on!

00:55:23.105 --> 00:55:24.705
It's dead quiet down there.

00:55:24.785 --> 00:55:26.025
No zombies are coming up.

00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:27.105
Of course!

00:55:28.465 --> 00:55:30.345
That's because they got Fah!

00:55:30.425 --> 00:55:31.425
Pao.

00:55:32.945 --> 00:55:33.905
What?

00:55:33.985 --> 00:55:35.985
-Pao, stop!
-Why didn't you wait for her?

00:55:36.065 --> 00:55:38.505
-Why were you in such a hurry?
-Pao, stop it!

00:55:38.905 --> 00:55:40.105
-Fucking stop!
-Huh?

00:55:40.185 --> 00:55:41.545
Answer me, damn it!

00:55:41.625 --> 00:55:42.625
Enough!

00:55:43.185 --> 00:55:45.745
If he didn't save you,
you'd be dead by now.

00:55:48.785 --> 00:55:49.865
Get to the rooftop.

00:55:50.465 --> 00:55:51.985
The girls should be up there.

00:55:52.065 --> 00:55:53.105
Let's go.

00:55:53.425 --> 00:55:54.505
Wait.

00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:08.145
Shit!

00:56:14.665 --> 00:56:15.545
Whoa…

00:56:15.625 --> 00:56:16.585
Let's go!

00:56:31.545 --> 00:56:33.545
Wash your hands, Win! Wash them!

00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:36.105
Come on.

00:56:37.665 --> 00:56:39.505
Wash them. Do it.

00:56:39.585 --> 00:56:40.465
Hurry.

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:49.905
Come off already.

00:57:07.145 --> 00:57:08.025
Win…

00:57:08.545 --> 00:57:10.625
Stay still. Don't move.

00:57:12.225 --> 00:57:13.345
If I say run…

00:57:14.465 --> 00:57:15.465
you run, okay?

00:57:39.545 --> 00:57:41.225
Run! Go!
