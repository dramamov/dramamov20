[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

[Episode 23]

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.850
Go.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.980
I heard

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.460
they're even stronger than those

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.210
of the Five Poisons Sect.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770
I've seen Wen Hujiu's Five Poisons.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.330
His centipedes

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.730
had two heads.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.050
What array is this?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.660
The Five-Poison Array.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.300
Ordinarily,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.380
it's used to trap people,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.570
penning them inside,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.360
then unleashing the venoms.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.220
It's our Wen clan's secret art,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.450
not taught outside.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.540
You're flipping it now

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.690
to isolate this floral poison?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.820
That's right.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.980
A toxin spread across the whole city...

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.340
I've never heard of it.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.850
To pull off poisoning technique like this,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.940
only three people alive could.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.100
First that comes to mind

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.890
is the Wen clan head,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.220
Wen Hujiu.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.660
My uncle's poisons

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.780
truly top the world.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.670
Three generations up,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.020
three down,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.940
you won't find his equal,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.170
a genius of poisoning technique.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.910
But he's allied

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.770
with Xueyue City,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.060
and would never meddle

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.380
in Wushuang City's mess.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.100
Besides,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.130
this poison

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.260
was clearly laid years in advance.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.010
My uncle's far too lazy for that.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.100
The second

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.220
is likely from the Tang clan.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.340
Right.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.610
Their top poisoner,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.820
Tang Linghuang.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.730
But the Tang clan

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.570
is also allied with Xueyue City.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.690
And besides,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.100
Tang Linghuang

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.170
only favors

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.660
poisons that kill.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.100
He even said,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.500
"If a poison

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.450
can't kill the target,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.380
it doesn't deserve the name".

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.820
On that point, his fixation

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.380
is practically

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.130
an obsession.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.780
Then the third?

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.730
The Five Poisons Sect master,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.100
the Poison Enchantress,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.410
Luo Yandie.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.940
Only she likes

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.690
floral-scented toxins.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.690
She prefers people

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.890
to drift off in warmth and perfume,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.450
dying without knowing it.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.660
Poisoners like that

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.450
have twisted tastes.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.970
Twisted or not,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.450
don't you already know?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.100
This Blossom Ash

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.650
only suppresses inner power for a while.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.850
It doesn't kill.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.220
Which means

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.890
they're holding a backup move.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.980
Right now in Sihuai City,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.610
quite a few top fighters have slipped in,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.380
including...

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.290
Sword Deities.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.410
So, Lu Yuzhai

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.570
refuses to work with us?

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.850
He says

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.380
his red line

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.690
is not harming his master.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.660
[Night Crow, the Ghost Physician]
So after he gets those two letters,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.810
he'll report to his master.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.850
I failed.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.780
I couldn't intercept those two letters in time.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.020
Sihuai's survival is at stake.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.490
Lu Yuzhai

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.580
will surely tell Song Yanhui.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.900
Liu Yunqi is dead.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.250
Jian Shanyue has retired.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.930
And Wushuang City now

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.340
has only Song Yanhui left.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.810
Looks like

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.850
the City Lord's seat

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.410
needs a new occupant.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.730
Your Highness means

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.460
the new City Lord of Wushuang City

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.780
should be...

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.780
Naturally, the Lunwu Hall chief,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.410
Jian Wudi.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.540
I've told you

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.170
I have no interest

[Jian Wudi of Wushuang City]

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.140
in the City Lord's seat.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.170
Of course.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.810
You can devote yourself to the sword.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.580
The Peerless Sword Coffer I promised

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.140
will be delivered to you.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.250
Much obliged, Your Highness.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.660
You're a man

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.580
obsessed with the sword.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.700
All who are obsessed,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.170
if they never awaken,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.250
their lives are ruined.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.220
If they do awaken,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.220
they soar through the clouds.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.370
For you to come out of seclusion now,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.980
you must have realized something.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.170
I need a fine swordsman to test it.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.850
It's long been prepared for you.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.050
I'll track down Zhuo Yue'an

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.540
and have him

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.250
test your blade.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.220
May you

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.810
ascend to the top

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.490
with one strike.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.810
Go with him.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.020
Perhaps

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.930
he will have use for you.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.730
As you command.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.900
What's wrong, Sir?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.300
[Luoyang Tavern]

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.980
This guy lives for the sword.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.970
Yet when it's time to cross blades,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.690
he hesitates.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.120
[Luoyang Tavern]
Maybe...

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.540
he's scared of Zhuo Yue'an?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.020
Luoyang Tavern...

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.170
Sir,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.250
do you want a drink here?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.140
To the west lies Muliang City,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.050
home to the Lone Sword Deity.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.850
He's said to be the strongest

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.310
of the Five Sword Deities.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.610
His name

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.050
is Luo Qingyang.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.900
Luo Qingyang

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.780
sealed his city long ago.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.140
All these years,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.900
he's never crossed swords with another Sword Deity.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.170
How can you call him number one?

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.020
There's someone inside!

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.010
What a fearsome sword energy!

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.650
Not just fearsome,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.250
what's most distinctive in it

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.420
is the killing intent.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.820
It's so heavy,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.530
and so dense.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.010
Within that killing intent

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.580
surges a wrathful sword intent.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.730
It's the strongest sword energy

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.100
I've ever seen.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.940
You've seen that many?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.340
A fair few.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.730
I'm Chief of Wushuang City's Lunwu Hall,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.850
Jian Wudi.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.770
Pleasure to meet you.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.940
Wushuang City?

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.730
Is it that impressive?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.460
Still, your name

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.850
is quite something.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.850
Jian Wudi...

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.820
Before me,

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.220
you dare claim you're unrivaled (wudi)?

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.850
Sir,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.770
who on earth is he?

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.610
Among the Five Sword Deities,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.940
he alone bears the word "fury".

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.250
He's the Furious Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.180
He wields the famed blade Breaker of Armies.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.610
Of the five,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.130
his slaughter aura is the heaviest.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.890
A worthy opponent.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.580
But it seems

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.770
he's trapped by the floral poison.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.010
He's using his sword energy

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.300
to barely carve out

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.220
a pocket of space.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.300
But he still can't leave this inn!

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.700
You think

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.420
such petty tricks can hold me?

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.460
In four hours,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.250
this floral poison

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.940
will lose all effect.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.650
Then I'll stride out, blade in hand,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.940
and none of you will live!

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.490
Oh, right,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.030
do you carry

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.490
the antidote to Blossom Ash?

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:37.820
I...

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.580
No!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.580
Sir,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.460
don't lose sight of the big picture.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.060
If you let him out,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.940
our plan could go up in smoke.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.180
Let's find Zhuo Yue'an first.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.850
Jian Wudi

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.100
really isn't right in the head.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.300
Just to face a Sword Deity,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.060
he'd hand Yan Zhantian the antidote.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.730
What a crazy idea.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.490
Forget it.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.370
If you're not fighting,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.100
then get lost!

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.010
No need to regret it.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.820
I'll cross blades with him one day.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.700
Why is that archfiend

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.490
in Sihuai City?

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.530
You think only one came?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.250
You mean...

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.850
there's more than one master?

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:24.610
No.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.850
I mean

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.220
more than one Sword Deity came.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.420
Sword...

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.460
Set the Sword Deities aside for now.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.010
Zhuo Yue'an

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.820
is in the courtyard up ahead.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.940
You experts can fight it out.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.850
No need for me to watch.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.700
After you.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.420
Come here!

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.340
Who is it this time?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.940
Only two people alive

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.490
could wield a sword energy this freezing.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.770
The Blizzard Blade won't come here,

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.580
so you must be...

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.300
Don't tell me my luck is that bad.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.250
Why aren't you poisoned?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.890
I don't know.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.180
Because you and the poisoner

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.490
are in it together.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.220
Hand over the antidote, now!

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.650
I...

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.420
I don't have it.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.350
Then die now!

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.060
Wait!

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.460
I do...

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:49.730
I do!

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.530
My girl,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.220
give me a pill.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.300
I'll go see what's happening outside.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.610
The Poison Enchantress told me

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.820
only a few can resist

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.980
this floral poison array.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.220
Young lady,

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.420
though you look young,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.650
you have quite the backing.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.980
Who are you?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.530
Dian Ye, the Flying Tiger General.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.330
[Dian Ye, the Flying Tiger General]
Not counting the Prince of Langya,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.770
his standing in the Beili Army

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.250
is second only to Commander-in-Chief Ye Xiaoying.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.610
A general...

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.770
what's he doing here?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.730
Good question.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.890
Why indeed?

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.420
Su Changhe,

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.340
Su Muyu,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.220
Blood River's current leaders,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.250
I'm here

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.890
for you, of course.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.650
As a court general,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.530
you're interested in Blood River?

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.580
What are you after?

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.770
You want this?

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.300
And this too?

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.850
Patriarch of Blood River,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.300
you're clever.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.460
How did the dragon-head hilt

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.700
of the Dormant Dragon Sword end up on your dagger?

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.650
I had Xie Qianji refit it.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.060
I don't use a longsword,

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.610
and lugging the Dormant Dragon Sword around

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.340
is a pain.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.220
Dian Ye

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.340
is First Prince Xiao Yong's uncle.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.100
And Xiao Yong is a leading contender

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.250
for the throne.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.580
Looks like they've planned this day

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.530
for a long time.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.770
They want to take Wushuang City

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.460
and seize Blood River's treasures.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.250
Su Muyu,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.580
this revenge duel of yours

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.940
has been thoroughly used.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.490
A sword is a noble weapon.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.250
Those who exploit it

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.730
will die by it.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.060
You know who we are,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.180
yet you came alone?

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.850
You've got a death wish, huh?

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.180
He's a general, after all.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.580
If you fight him openly,

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.250
head-on,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.420
you'll only bring Blood River trouble.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.370
Let me do it instead.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.420
Anyway,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.300
I'm just a free blade from Nan'an.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.100
For you two youngsters,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.420
I'll test

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.980
the general's golden axe.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.610
That city

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.010
has begun to stir.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.460
Tonight?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.980
The news shouldn't spread so fast.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.340
But by the signs before,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.130
tonight is when they strike.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.220
However,

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.460
what they didn't expect

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.130
is that Sihuai City today

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.770
is no ordinary Sihuai City.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.250
They lured Blood River over,

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.180
while I invited

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.420
three Sword Deities

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.610
to watch the show.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.940
Xiao Yong

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.770
meant to use this chance

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.490
to control Wushuang City

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.010
and grow his power.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.820
But he never imagined

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.940
Su Muyu

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.100
would deliberately tip us off

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.250
that someone meant

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.370
to use him.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.180
Su Muyu is a clever one.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.250
In this Wushuang turmoil,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.100
the final break

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.980
still rests on his choice:

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.370
whether to remain Su Muyu

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.890
or become Zhuo Yue'an.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.330
Now that is a master.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.250
Who goes there?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.940
Jian Wudi.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.980
What an arrogant name.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.010
Today is my first bout since leaving seclusion.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.490
Anyone not fighting,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.860
clear out.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.570
General Dian Ye,

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.090
you can just watch.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.570
Seems

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.860
you have some right

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.180
to be arrogant.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.530
Xiao Yong promised me

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.250
a fine "sword"

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.810
to test my skills.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.770
Looks like

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.810
you're the "sword" I came for!

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.770
I've always accompanied Su Muyu

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.810
to these duels,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.860
finding them silly.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.420
He liked them,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.490
so I played along.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.660
But now...

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.770
Suddenly it feels

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.290
like it means something?

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.090
No.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.770
It suddenly feels even sillier.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.770
Because Su Muyu seems

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.490
unable to beat that man.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.730
A fine "sword" indeed.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.050
In you,

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.730
I see my father's shadow.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.380
Zhuo Yuluo, Lord of No-Sword City.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.250
With a pure sword-heart,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.460
he's an absolute devotee of the Sword's Way.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.700
Other than my father,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.460
I've never seen

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.980
such pure sword intent.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.660
One who wields the sword

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.380
must keep a single mind.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.290
Seems that battle at Wushuang City

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.290
no longer matters.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.330
It's my honor

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.090
to cross blades with you.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.420
My last stroke

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.980
held intent, no technique.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.490
You blocked it beautifully.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.810
But every stroke that follows

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.090
won't be like the last,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.180
only growing stronger

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.940
and harsher.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.730
All the better.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.420
True masters of the Sword's Way

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.330
each bear their own sword intent.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.180
His intent

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.730
is pure,

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.290
without a speck of impurity.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.810
A decade honing one blade,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.420
that is true purity.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.180
Do you feel it?

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.490
As if rain is coming.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.860
There's a chill.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.860
His sword energy

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.380
carries a trace of rain.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.860
Fine "sword"!

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.330
Looks like a brilliant duel.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.250
It is.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.140
Truly brilliant.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.010
You're here.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.050
So from now on,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.900
the jianghu will have six Sword Deities?

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.060
♪Watch the flames across the river...♪

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.770
Seems Su Muyu

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.700
has met a worthy foe.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.250
He even spent

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.060
his trump card.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.290
You called my sword intent

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.490
the purest

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.420
you've ever seen.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.250
But yours

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.050
is the most complex

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.220
I've seen.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.940
Your sword intent carries

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.810
too many feelings:

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.570
anger,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.770
defiance,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:58.810
forbearance,

00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.530
compromise,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.380
even gentleness...

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.620
almost the full range

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.940
of a human heart.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.700
What have you lived through

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.050
to swing

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.940
so complex a blade?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.980
♪This battle is mine alone, against myself♪

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.580
♪The path lies beneath my feet. I see muddy prints...♪

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.940
And then

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.140
all falls quiet.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.900
You lost?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.380
I won.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.620
Not good.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.050
Very not good.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.010
If you won,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.490
why is it not good?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.940
Because Su Muyu

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.770
used his strongest strike

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.730
yet didn't kill him.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.290
And the opponent

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.090
hasn't gone all out.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.730
That last strike was excellent.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.180
May I have its name?

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.570
Rain Surge.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.420
Rain Surge...

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.770
I call myself Jian Wudi,

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.220
yet in my first fight out of seclusion

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.660
against my first opponent,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.620
I lost.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.940
But from

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.660
that strike just now,

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.660
I've gained new insight.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.940
With the next stroke,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.420
you will lose...

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.290
and die.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.860
My turn.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.250
Let me try again.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.660
None of you are getting away.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.620
Indeed...

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.010
Pure sword intent

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.660
is rare in this world.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.050
But when anything

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.770
pushes past

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.220
the point of return,

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.570
the utmost good

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.980
turns to utmost evil,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.250
the utmost evil

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.220
becomes utmost good;

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.940
and the brightest light

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.490
is nothing but darkness.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.770
He's about

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.570
to go fully demonic.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.940
If going demonic makes my sword stronger,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.810
why not?

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.980
If you don't turn back

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.330
and keep wielding the sword like this,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.900
within a year,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.490
your sword intent will turn on you.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.180
Your inner channels will snap and you'll die!

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.900
My father was devoted to the sword too,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.220
but he never ignored

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.530
his family or his people.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:28.660
You can treat the sword

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.900
as the most important thing,

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.810
but it

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.330
must not be the only thing.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.140
People may betray you,

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.810
but a sword...

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.290
won't!

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.290
After all this time,

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.810
you still follow

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.620
such an extreme Way of the Sword.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.860
It's you.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.330
Our duel

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.770
will have to wait.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.290
If so,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.730
let's join hands against him.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.220
A fortunate turn, perhaps.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.620
Senior Wudi!

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.140
Long time no see!

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.290
All these years,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.620
why are you still

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.620
at the same realm?

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.900
The longer you hold the bottleneck,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.290
the stronger the breakthrough.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.980
I've been waiting for the moment,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.380
one strike to divinity.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.090
One strike...

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.980
to divinity?

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.460
A pity.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.330
You won't get that chance!

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.660
Senior Wudi,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.700
seems you've joined the chaos too.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.530
Since you've betrayed Wushuang City,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.730
don't blame me

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.980
for putting duty over kin!

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.900
Before he went demonic,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.220
he was close to a Sword Deity.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.810
Now, fully demonic,

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.530
his power is immeasurable.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.330
As City Lord of Wushuang,

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.380
I can't best anyone after all?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.140
At the peak comes decline.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.620
A demonic body looks mighty,

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.380
but it's hollow.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.090
Find the weak point

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.380
and one strike will kill!

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.010
Someone steeped in obsession

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.700
is going demonic here.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.290
It's from the Scholarly Sword Deity.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:10.530
One Stroke Cuts Water!

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.090
Swallow Turns Back!

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.700
I have a strike too!

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.530
It's called...

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.250
Mountain Rain at Dusk!

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.050
After fresh rain on empty hills,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.380
autumn comes with the evening chill.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.770
You live for the sword,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.380
but a sword is a dead thing.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.530
Living for dead things

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.940
will get you hit a dead end.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.490
But the only thing that stays with me

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.220
is my sword.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.900
Everything else

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.220
leaves me.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.220
Senior Wudi.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.980
I didn't win...

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.570
but you

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.940
didn't really either.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.700
General Dian,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.860
we'll spare you this once.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.180
From now on, be careful.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.180
And stop scheming

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.380
against Blood River.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.490
We didn't duel today,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.220
but after this fight,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.050
I have no regrets.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.290
Never thought

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.010
Blood River

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.330
would have a swordsman like you.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.140
What?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.980
Should everyone in Blood River

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.660
be like me?

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.420
You two, don't just stand there.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.800
You burned through a lot of sword moves today.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.900
Sit right now

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.700
and reset your breath.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:33.770
Remember:

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.010
after a fight,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.570
you must promptly regulate

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.460
your breathing.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.270
Awesome!

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.490
Yeah, really awesome!

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.380
Senior, your strike

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.900
was crisp and commanding.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.660
No wonder Master says

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.030
you're the most gifted

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.810
among our generation.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:06.380
Right.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.290
If the City Lord watches training,

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.010
he might take a shine to you

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.330
and accept you as a personal disciple!

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.180
That's not enough.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.810
My force isn't enough.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.900
I still need work.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.900
You're ever striving for perfection.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.090
In time,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.460
you'll be Wushuang City's backbone,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.290
the pillar we all rely on!

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.530
The City Lord is here!

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.250
Greetings, Sir!

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.530
Enough.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.290
Yanhui,

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.490
this place

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.140
is the practice ground

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.810
of Wushuang City.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.180
By day, I handle affairs.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.530
In the meantime,

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:52.570
you can come here

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.290
and spar with the brothers.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.810
At dusk,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.180
return to the City Lord's manor

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.570
to work your forms.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.770
His name is Yanhui.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.810
You lot,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.140
look after him.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.570
- Got it! - Got it!

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.250
Senior Jian,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.490
you okay?

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.420
Again!

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.090
Come on!

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.530
Senior Jian,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.420
I need to get back and train at the manor.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.010
See you tomorrow.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.490
I will beat you.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.380
I will beat you!

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.620
Even if you have the strongest master

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.420
and practice the finest sword art,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.810
I will beat you!

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.510
I, Jian Wudi,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.980
don't yield!

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.290
I, Jian Wudi,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.900
am meant to be unrivaled!

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.940
Senior Wudi,

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.380
at first light tomorrow,

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.940
I'll have people see you buried.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.810
As for our brotherhood...

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.010
let's carry it to the next life.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.380
How did you avoid this floral poison?

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.900
A Sword Deity

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.900
trapped by a petty floral poison,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.700
isn't that ridiculous?

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.050
Truly ridiculous.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.530
So,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.490
how did you break free?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.940
Teach your brother here.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.810
Naturally...

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.460
with an antidote.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.250
Third City Lord gave it to you?

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.460
No way.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.980
Xueyue Sword Deity,

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.730
you're Xueyue City's Second City Lord.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.290
Yet you act

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.770
so rough

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.620
and rude,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.860
truly...

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.220
a "heroine among women"!

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.140
Hand over all your antidote.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.090
My antidote for this floral poison

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.980
is worth a fortune.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.770
It's not something for charity.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.140
Who are you trying to save now?

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.330
Me.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.730
Wait, who are you?

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.330
I'm Xie Xuan.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.010
Xie Xuan...

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.490
Any antidote left?

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.290
Yes... yes!

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.050
Right here.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.490
Much obliged, good sir.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.700
By the way, City Lord Li,

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.380
In the city,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.570
there are still many jianghu folks

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.570
poisoned by this floral poison.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.050
As Sword Deities,

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.740
we should lend a hand.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.940
There's plenty of antidote in this vial.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.460
This floral poison

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.940
seems weaker than before.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.860
How do we save them?

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.980
Grind the antidote to powder

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.570
and spread it across the city.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.490
Since the toxin came from flowers,

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.010
let flowers end it.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.340
In this world,

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.780
only you can bring a city of blossoms

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.420
with a single sword.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.610
All right.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.460
This...

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.130
this is the fabled...

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.340
The Floral Sword Art!

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.780
[Luoyang Tavern]

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.650
No more waiting!

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.610
I actually cleared the poison thanks to that woman.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.130
How vexing.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.300
Your swordwork

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.980
is still as beautiful.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.650
On my way here,

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.780
I ran into some folks from Baixiao Hall.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.780
They asked me a favor.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.420
I hate that kind of thing.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.650
However,

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.300
my mother and he both serve

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.260
among the Four Guardians.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.460
Since Mother asked me to help him,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.530
of course I will.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:49.940
Good thing

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.130
I ran into you.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.610
I see.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.260
So Ji Ruofeng gathered us here

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.460
not for a show,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.130
but with his own designs.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.780
But Baixiao Hall came to you.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.530
What's that to me?

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.260
I cleared your poison just now.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.980
- I... - I did you a favor.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.260
You owe me.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.610
I suppose

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.420
your sages' books

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.460
teach that too, no?

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.690
You speak true.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.980
What do you need from me?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.170
Take us to your master.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.650
Sword Deity, you jest.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.690
If I take you, I'm dead.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.570
Just leave a little early

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.780
before we arrive.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.820
If you don't take us,

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.910
- you die right now. - I...

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.490
Hey!

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.010
I can't help anyway.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.650
Lead on.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:46.900
This way, please.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.490
Driver,

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.010
we'll borrow your carriage.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:52.980
It's dangerous in the city.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.300
Wait here.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.460
At daybreak,

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.490
we'll be back.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:58.820
All right.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.090
What was that all about?

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.860
We came all this way,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.860
saw no good fight,

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.260
and now we're cleaning up

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.130
Baixiao Hall's mess.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.610
Pretty frustrating, huh?

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.050
Fair enough.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.340
Once we're done,

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.010
let me cross blades

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.210
with the Scholarly Sword Deity.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.900
Then it's worth the trip.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.570
They say Song Yanhui

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.210
crossed swords with you

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.260
and lost badly.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.610
How come you're still keen on his swordwork?

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.900
Song's swordwork is indeed good,

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.340
but

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.090
Wushuang City holds him back.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.650
Also,

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.340
I want to see

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.170
Su Muyu's swordwork.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.210
Weren't you together

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.780
in the siege on Ye Dingzhi?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.380
Didn't you see his swordwork?

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.740
He once said

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.300
his "sword"

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.650
is no sword...

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.090
it's a killing tool.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.940
Only when he returns under a new name

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.610
will you see his true swordwork.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.490
He's powerful.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.860
If not for him back then,

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.050
we'd never have wounded

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.090
Ye Dingzhi so badly.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.010
This Blossom Ash

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.340
isn't as thick as before.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.530
I'll pack up

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.860
and we can leave this courtyard.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:48.980
Mr. Zhuo.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.340
After this fight,

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.860
our test duel

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.420
will likely be delayed.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.010
Someone wants to use our bout

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:01.940
for trouble.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.980
If it stirs up chaos

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.860
and innocents die again,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.860
the trial loses its point.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.260
Besides,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.260
fighting side by side,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.860
I've felt your sword intent.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.490
It's good.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.300
Had my father met you then,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.380
perhaps

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.340
it wouldn't have ended that way.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.300
Wushuang City owes No-Sword City,

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.210
and owes you.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.740
I trained in Blood River,

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.650
but I'm here

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.780
to carry my father's Way.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.940
I only meant

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.900
to avenge him

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.860
and restore No-Sword City's name,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.380
not to wreck Wushuang.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.260
Push it

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.380
and I'd be another Liu Yunqi.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.260
My master was mortally hurt

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.170
and has passed.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.300
He was my enemy

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.530
and your master.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.170
Now vengeance is done,

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.130
I'm pleased.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.490
But such joy should not be shown

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.300
before you.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.860
I understand.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.260
Mr. Zhuo,

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.380
until we meet again.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.650
If there's a chance,

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.740
I'd like to see your sword

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.380
shine even more dazzling.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.690
I fear that won't be me.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.740
But Wushuang City

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.570
will have a finer "sword"

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.570
to meet you.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.050
Farewell.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:39.490
Let's go too.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.090
He took a mortal strike

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.780
from you two.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.570
He can't be alive!

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.980
No pain,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.130
no fear,

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.530
only the will to kill.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.090
That's not something "going demonic"

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.860
can explain.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.130
Could it be...

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:10.980
What?

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.940
It's Xichu's drugged puppet art!

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:13.980
It makes the dead

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.010
rise and fight.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.820
Back when Xichu

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.570
fought Beili,

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.050
they used it

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.420
to drag the war on.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.610
It defies heaven's order.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.900
But its power was so strange

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.980
the Scholarly Deity of Xichu

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.780
couldn't bear to destroy it,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.690
and passed it to Medicine King Valley,

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.900
hoping the Valley

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.980
could find a way

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.900
to turn this evil art

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.260
to the right.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.090
So your Valley

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.210
ended up with it.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.570
Did you fix it?

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.860
No.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:41.980
It's so perverse

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.090
that even Xin Baicao

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.170
couldn't grasp it.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.820
I have a martial niece,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.420
Xin Baicao's junior sister,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.380
named Night Crow.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.610
Her husband died early,

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:50.300
so she grew obsessed

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.530
with "revival" arts,

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.420
and kept studying

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.380
the drugged puppet craft.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:54.900
Later,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.900
she betrayed the Valley

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.740
and took the manual.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.130
She's now

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.340
the only one who knows it.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.570
How to break it?

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.340
Thirteen Glances Back!

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.530
Freshly made a drugged puppet,

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:09.460
his foul blood circulates poorly.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.610
I pinned him.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.130
Su Muyu,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.530
shred his heart with one stroke!

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.300
That ends it, right?

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:30.900
My girl!

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.050
What went wrong?

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.260
His poisoned blood

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.860
is already in me.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.820
Troublesome.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:45.340
Su Muyu,

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.860
there's a jade vial at my waist.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.010
Take the pill inside

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.130
and give it to me.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.090
Are you fine now?

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.820
The puppet poison

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.340
isn't that easy to cure.
