[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 24]

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.980
Why is this happening?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.210
His poisonous blood

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.740
has entered my body.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.690
This is bad.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.260
Su Muyu,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.690
there's a jade vial at my waist.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.850
Take a pill

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.820
for me.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.020
Will you be all right after taking it?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.660
The drugged-puppet poison

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.930
isn't ordinary.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.930
Father,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.460
send word back to Nan'an City at once.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.410
Tell Zhaoyan

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.980
to release the carrier pigeon.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.780
The pigeon will

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.570
fly straight back to Medicine King Valley.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.890
If Xin Baicao sees it,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.570
he'll come to Nan'an City for me.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.130
Only he

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.130
can save me.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.820
All right.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.540
All right.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.690
We'll leave for Nan'an City immediately.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.170
Who's there?

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.610
Don't you enjoy this?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.290
Sitting there sipping tea,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.500
telling everyone

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.380
what they should do.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.220
It must feel

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.980
like everything's under your control.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.850
Who are you?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.660
You don't know who I am,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.890
but I know who you are.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.780
Xiao Yong, the First Prince.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.450
How dare you call my name directly?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.260
I've found you people of Tianqi City

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.450
very interesting.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.240
Always judging others

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.220
by your own rules.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.540
You think

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.290
that even if someone sees through your identity,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.130
they won't dare say it out loud?

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.010
You shouldn't look at me that way.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.210
There will always be people

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.090
who couldn't care less about your rules.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.690
Whether it's Tianqi City,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.810
the Xiao imperial line,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.770
or even your emperor,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.250
they're worthless to me.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.490
Who on earth are you?

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.340
You want to know my name

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.690
and get payback?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.090
Fine.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.770
I'm Li Hanyi.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.620
I live in Xueyue City.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.020
My senior brother

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.460
once fought your father

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.530
and left him powerless

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.250
in front of all the masters of Tianqi.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.020
We've stayed in Xueyue City all this time,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.980
yet you never dared

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.180
seek us for revenge.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.130
You made such a fuss

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.570
to take down Wushuang City

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.860
only because

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.540
you feared us, right?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.250
Sword Deity Xueyue,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.060
Li Hanyi.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.060
What are you doing here?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.180
Where's your elegance?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.060
Where's your composure?

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.930
Come on.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.490
Summon your men

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.980
and kill me.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.330
Your mother

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.330
is head of the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.220
yet you act so treasonously

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.660
by attacking a prince.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.220
Can you bear

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.490
such a crime?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.180
A prince shouldn't leave Tianqi without cause.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.980
You appear here in Sihuai City,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.250
and accuse me of treason?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.100
My mother guards Tianqi,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.740
not you scheming princes.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.180
Fine.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.860
City Lord Li,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.540
I believe

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.130
today's matter

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.740
has nothing to do with Xueyue City.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.690
Why must you keep pushing?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.180
If I ran into it,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.180
then I'm involved.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.860
That's enough.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.330
Don't frighten him.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.690
Chancellor Xie?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.810
You still remember me, Your Highness.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.740
Are you also here to stop me?

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.540
That depends on how you see it.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.180
You think I'm trying to stop you,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.930
but in fact I'm helping you.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.130
If you seize Wushuang City,

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.780
it won't be good.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.370
Flying Tiger General

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.250
has a troop at my disposal

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.420
outside the city.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.450
Once I give the order,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.330
the entire Sihuai City

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.100
could be flattened.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.250
With City Lord Li and me

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.130
defending the city,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.010
even twice that number

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.780
couldn't breach our defense

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.100
by a zhang.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.570
It's rare to hear you speak so boldly.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.180
No.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.810
That was modest.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.220
Without you,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.300
I

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.810
and my three-chi sword
[*Chi: Chinese unit of length, about 33 cm]

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.930
could keep them three chi away.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.010
I'll remember

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.130
what happened today.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.420
Annoying.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.780
I'll just kill him once and for all.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.420
No.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.810
He's a prince, after all.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.930
If you kill him,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.330
you'll put your mother at risk.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.370
I'll kill him quietly.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.570
This fellow

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.620
looks no good.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.100
Who knows how many innocent lives he's taken?

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.620
Killing him

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.620
is not wrong.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.330
You deserve a place

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.780
among the four great fiends of the martial world.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.860
Let's go.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.900
You weren't serious about

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.930
killing him just now, were you?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.210
I'm not that stupid.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.060
Why bring trouble on myself?

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.570
I was only scaring him.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.060
Well then, we...

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.210
Since the duel is canceled,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.060
I'll return to Xueyue City.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.780
It's rare for you to leave Xueyue City.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.730
Why not go somewhere else?

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.180
You talk too much.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.690
Your temper is too big.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.500
After all, I'm on par with your senior brother.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.730
By seniority,

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.690
I'm the Eighth Young Master.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.540
He's the Ninth Young Master.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.610
I'm his senior.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.540
But when you speak to me,

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.780
I always feel threatened.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.630
Because you always refuse

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.730
to spar with me.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.690
I'd love to challenge

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.380
the sword of the Scholarly Sword Deity.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.730
If you duel me,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.420
I'll invite you to Xueyue City

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.090
to taste my senior brother's

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.810
freshly brewed Beauty of Four Seasons.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.060
That brew is superb.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.930
But dueling you

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.780
isn't.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.730
Bookworm!

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.090
Shrew.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.090
Su Changhe?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.790
He didn't stop by for a chat

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.300
when he saw two sword deities.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.330
Looks like they're in big trouble.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.180
Soon,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.780
I'll fall asleep.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.670
I might not wake

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.570
for ten days or longer.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.330
Don't worry.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.540
Once we reach Nan'an City

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.060
and Baicao arrives,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.140
everything will be fine.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.450
All right.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.260
Don't worry, Miss Bai.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.810
But if

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.780
he doesn't get there in time,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.180
I'll turn into a drugged puppet.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.810
Before I become something ugly,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.420
use your sword

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.660
and kill me.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.930
Do you hear me?

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.060
He doesn't.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.540
He can't hear you.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.610
The King of Medicine will surely come.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.090
But there's always a chance

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.330
it goes wrong.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.330
Promise me.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.780
Kill me.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.930
Father,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.540
you're not to stop him.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.830
Buns for sale!

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.130
Meat buns, fresh from the steamer!

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.450
Yu and Uncle Zhe

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.570
are inside with Master.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.380
I'm not sure when Master will wake.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.610
Changhe,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.730
what has happened?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.640
I asked you to release the carrier pigeon.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.210
Did you release it?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.970
Of course.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.970
But your letter didn't say why.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.730
Your master was struck by a strange poison.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.610
Only the King of Medicine Xin Baicao can cure it.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.690
The carrier pigeon was meant to send to the Medicine King Valley.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.900
But the King of Medicine hasn't arrived yet.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.140
I fear it may be too late.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.210
No.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.090
Fate is on Master's side.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.420
She'll pull through safely.

[He-Yu Clinic]

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.570
He-Yu Clinic?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.210
The "He" is Senior,

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.690
then who is this "Yu"?

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.500
[He-Yu Clinic]

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.420
Mister, are you here for a consultation?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.210
Are you Yu?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.020
Rain?

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.690
What rain?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.090
Oh, nothing.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.380
It must be a mistake.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.850
I came here

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.060
looking for my senior.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.450
Please announce me.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.730
Senior?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.780
We have no one

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.180
that old here.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.540
Medicine King Valley Xin Baicao.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:43.970
Zhaoyan,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.020
by seniority,

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.780
you may call him

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.780
Senior Brother.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.380
You finally came!

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.330
Please come in.

[He-Yu Clinic]

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.090
Master.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.180
Baicao,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.690
you're here.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.540
The first thing you do

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.690
when we meet

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.090
is to take advantage of me.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.330
Yes, I'm here,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.900
Senior.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.140
How lovely.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.850
I heard Xin Baicao, the King of Medicine, had arrived.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.690
I didn't know the Medicine King Valley's rules

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.970
were so strict.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.850
If I were him,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.090
I couldn't stand it.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.420
She's my senior after all.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.420
The Grandmaster loved talent

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.500
and couldn't help

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.690
but take in promising disciples.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.210
As expected of the King of Medicine.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.260
A few needles

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.210
and the illness is cured.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.850
Cured?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.970
Hasn't she been cured yet?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.450
Uh...

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.420
Please leave.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.060
I need a moment

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.090
to change

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.020
before speaking with Baicao.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.930
Are you a swordsman?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.260
Maybe.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.810
May I ask,

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.450
what's your relation to Senior?

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.140
I happened

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.260
to look for her to treat my elder,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.730
and over time,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.970
we became friends.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.380
Later, my friend

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.780
bought

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:10.730
this place

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.690
and opened this clinic

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.300
for Miss Bai and me.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.970
The "Yu" in the sign

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.540
is me.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.540
So it is.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.690
May I ask,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.090
what's your name?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.780
Su Muyu.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.660
That's a good name.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.420
May I ask,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.450
are you the Su Muyu

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.730
I've heard of?

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.420
Maybe.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.210
I knew

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.020
she'd surprise me

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.450
when we met again,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.450
but I didn't expect

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.180
it to be this shocking.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.570
She actually opened a clinic

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.180
with Blood River.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.020
We kill,

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.300
and she saves lives.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.610
People who seem to belong to completely different paths

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.900
running a clinic together

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.060
is truly baffling.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.180
I see now.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.930
It must be love.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.300
It must be love!

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.570
Why are you laughing?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.930
It's certainly not you.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.330
You don't look

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.730
like a good man.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.970
That's you, then.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.420
So Senior likes

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.380
the cold, elegant type?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.380
I didn't expect that.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.610
I really didn't.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.330
What about you?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.540
You're Su Muyu,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.690
then who is he to the Su family?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.810
Me?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.690
I'm Su Changhe.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.380
The Undertaker Su Changhe?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.020
King of Medicine,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.330
that used to be

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.890
my title.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.260
Now,

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.700
I'm the Patriarch of Blood River.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.260
And who are you to the Su family?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.500
I'm Su Zhe.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.980
I'll take my leave.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.170
Sir.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.810
Baicao,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.300
where are you going?

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.540
Senior,

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.410
you look rosy

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.260
and lively again.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.300
You must be fine now.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.780
There's no such thing as drugged puppets.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.850
Nonsense.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.260
I only gave a few needles,

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.540
and you're cured.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.260
No need to keep me for dinner.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.810
I'll take my leave.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.890
Don't worry, sir.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.780
Dark River

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.370
is not what it used to be.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.020
But is the Undertaker

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.370
any different from before?

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.610
You hesitated.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.890
You faltered.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.170
Baicao,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.060
stop teasing Su Muyu.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.090
Su Zhe

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.260
is the father I've searched for all these years.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.780
Greetings, King of Medicine.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.540
This is complicated.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.500
In any case,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.890
we won't hurt you.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.780
Please check Miss Bai quickly.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.090
Su Muyu,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.700
before reforming Blood River,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:28.930
shouldn't Uncle Zhe and I

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.060
do some good deeds

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.980
in the martial world,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.090
so that people think differently of us?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.570
It's confirmed

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.500
to be Night Crow's drugged puppet craft.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.460
Her mastery

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.940
has deepened

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.460
far beyond

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.410
when she left

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.780
the valley.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.700
That's why I called you.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.980
Miss Bai,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.260
I'm curious.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.700
Compared to the King of Medicine,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.570
who's the better physician?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.020
Am I the King of Medicine,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.780
or is he?

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.940
If my skill surpasses his

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.090
and my seniority is higher,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.610
he wouldn't be called

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.020
King of Medicine.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.650
You flattered me, Senior.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.260
Tell me plainly.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.540
Can the drugged-puppet poison

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.540
in my body

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.700
be removed?

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.130
You took

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.610
the Heart-Reviving Pill in time,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.500
and with acupuncture,

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.700
the poisonous worms are dead.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.170
Only the residual toxin

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.220
remains.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.850
Those poisonous worms can be killed,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.330
but the residue is hard to get rid of?

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.260
The record says

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.700
that those with poisonous worms

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.330
become uncontrollable drugged puppets.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.410
Become a drugged puppet?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.850
How can that not be a problem?

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.850
By then,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.220
Senior may already be dead.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.610
Let's be realistic.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.980
It has nothing to do

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.300
with her.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.570
But if someone dies

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.890
and they won't rest in peace,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.890
thinking about it now,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.740
it feels

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.130
awful.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.980
Can you remove it?

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.090
If you can't,

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.890
once I find Night Crow,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.700
I'll bring her here.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.020
Don't worry.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.740
It'll certainly be removed.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.740
It's just that

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.260
I need a bit of help.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.570
What help?

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.890
I'll do whatever is required.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.610
This isn't ordinary acupuncture.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.700
I'll insert

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.330
thirteen silver needles into Senior's body.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.650
When that's done,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.980
her qi and blood will surge,

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.570
as if she's fallen into a volcano.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.650
At that moment,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.030
the fewer obstructions

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.610
to the flow of her zhenqi,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.020
the better.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.330
I'm not a physician. I don't quite follow.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.890
Idiot.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.460
It means that during the procedure,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.890
Miss Bai should wear only a single inner garment.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.540
Rude.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.650
A true healer only cares for their patient.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.070
I do this only to save her life.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.500
I have a clear conscience.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.300
But

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.260
Mr. Su, you...

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.220
No problem.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.700
If he can't do it,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.500
I can.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.650
I have a clear conscience too.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.300
I swear.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.500
I'll kill you.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.090
Easy, easy.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.060
Let's talk nicely.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.700
You're even launching the Purple Qi from the East?

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.850
Just smelling that

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.850
could kill them.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.980
If it can't be cured, forget it.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.700
It's your call.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.610
We're fine with that.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.650
Uncle Zhe,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.410
you're her father.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.170
You decide for her.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.740
I could decide to kill you instead.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.220
Well...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.940
I have an idea.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.100
[He-Yu Clinic]

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.060
Uncle Zhe,

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.700
aren't you worried about your daughter's condition?

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.220
The King of Medicine is here.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.700
There's nothing to worry about.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.410
Uncle Zhe,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.370
have you attended

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.650
a wedding banquet in your life?

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.460
People like us

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.890
only send others to their graves.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.220
I've been to plenty of funerals.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.850
But as for weddings,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.980
I've only had my own.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.780
Back then, I was on the run

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.170
with Hehuai's mother.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.540
We passed by an abandoned temple

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.650
and were married there.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.060
We had the wedding ritual

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.890
and drank the last jar of liquor

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.810
we had.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.850
I suppose that counts.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.090
What did the liquor taste like?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.090
Sweet.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.810
I thought you only drank sorghum liquor.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.460
I've heard the only fruit liquor in the South is sweet.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.020
It was sorghum liquor.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.890
But that day,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.130
it tasted sweet.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.700
I'm a good drinker,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.610
but I got drunk that day,

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.540
and...

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.060
And?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.810
And then my daughter was born.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.170
I've never attended a wedding banquet before,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.700
but if I ever get the chance,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.610
I'd like to.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.780
Changhe,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.980
that sounds like

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.220
you're hinting at something.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.260
You know what I'm saying.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.090
There's no need to be impatient.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.300
Senior.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.610
Please pardon me.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.890
Uncle Zhe,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.980
do you think

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.650
it'd be nice

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.170
to settle down in Nan'an City?

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.090
Are you possessed by Su Muyu?

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.200
I just suddenly understand

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.460
how Muyu felt.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.540
You're the Patriarch now.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.020
Where there's one Nan'an City,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.000
there could be ten

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.850
or a hundred.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.300
If we find our Nan'an City,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.810
they can find theirs too.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.740
With one command,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.130
everyone scatters across the land,

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.610
each living their own life.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.220
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.810
Not everyone

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.170
wants that kind of life.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.650
We come from the martial world.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.090
Who doesn't dream

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.220
of ruling

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.700
and conquering?

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.330
We've stood at the top before.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.780
We know the view from above isn't everything.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.850
But in Blood River,

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.260
there are many who don't.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.890
They have ambition.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.940
If you disband the group,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.460
they'll just die

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.650
on some other battlefield.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.980
I overlooked that.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.780
I could choose this path.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.130
Su Muyu could also choose it.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.890
But you have no choice.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.220
Because you're the Patriarch.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.610
Senior,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.740
now,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.610
I'll insert the last needle.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.260
I suppose

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.780
you know the pain.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.330
Please endure a little.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.500
Rise, drop.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.330
Mr. Su.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.130
Yes.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.030
Right here.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:44.940
Now.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:45.980
Got it.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.890
I'm tired.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.220
Miss Bai has fallen asleep.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.540
She's all right.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.570
I knew

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.700
everything would be fine.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.130
I'm hungry.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.570
Do you want to try

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.540
fried egg with green pepper?

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.010
Yu.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.060
Since the King of Medicine is here,

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.500
can we go out for something better?

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:02.850
Come on.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.850

for a feast of thirteen fine dishes

and a jar of Luobai liquor.

Be honest.

and book the best private room.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.500
We'll treat the King of Medicine,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.220
who came from afar,

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.120
to a feast of thirteen fine dishes.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.090
My treat.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.980
Yes, sir!

[Fushou Restaurant]

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.850
I can't believe this.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.330
I didn't expect falling ill

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.130
would have this upside.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.980
We get to eat at Fushou Restaurant.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.220
Right.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.090
It's on me.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.400
The grandest feast

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.650

You look

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.330
almost benevolent.

I promise.

You've just recovered.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.980
Why push yourself

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.330
to get out of bed

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.940
and come all the way here?

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.810
That's because

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.740
I usually prepare meals

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.460
at the clinic.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.550
So it must be your cooking

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.610
that's terrible,

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.330
right?

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.650
You haven't tried it.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.260
How do you know it's bad?

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.090
Well...

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.890
My apologies.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.330
I was being rude.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.780
You can have a try.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.850
This is the osmanthus cake Muyu made.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.130
Try it.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.410
Isn't osmanthus cake

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.130
supposed to be white?

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480
I added

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.300
tea foam to it.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.540
Now it has both osmanthus fragrance

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.740
and tea aroma.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.060
You're so thoughtful.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.780
He's really thoughtful.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.300
Ew!

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.570
This...

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.940
This...

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.540
Gosh!

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.020
This...

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.060
Looks like

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.810
I still need to improve my cooking.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.060
I didn't know

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.740
someone as mischievous

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:32.570
as Senior

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.940
would fall so low.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.740
Excuse me.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.850
Yes, sir.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.850
How may I help you, sir?

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.780
We'll have another feast.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:47.980
Served in an hour.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:48.710
Sure.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.300
Hold on.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.330
Yes, sir?

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.810
This yam cake is good.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.300
How do you make it?

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.260
I'm just a waiter, sir.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.170
I can't cook.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.810
If you like,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.570
I can bring you to see our cook.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.060
You may ask him yourself.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.130
No need.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:05.980
You can go.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.610
Enjoy your meal.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.700
Cooking

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.940
has levels.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.370
You think

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.170
you're at level two,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.890
but you're actually

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:19.890
at level one.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.780
The dishes here

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.940
are level five.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:23.650
So

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.830
you can try

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.700
level-one dishes.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.060
Master,

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.020
what are level-one dishes?

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.980
For instance,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:33.940
this one.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.810
Fried egg with green pepper.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.370
This is way too simple.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.330
Su Muyu,

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.650
there was once a swordsman

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.410
who practiced only nineteen Embroidered-Sword moves

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.090
and eventually became a sword deity.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.810
Start with simple dishes,

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.940
and one day you'll make imperial feasts.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.610
That's too much.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.840
At least

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.060
you could run a small restaurant.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.130
When that happens,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.570
we call it

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.940
Blood River

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:09.850
Palace.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.570
Blood River Palace?

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.780
It sounds

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.500
a little improper.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.650
Fushou Restaurant's pastries are average.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.780
I'll go

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.440
to Jinyue Pastry

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.410
to buy some.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.650
Su Changhe,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.540
why do you look

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.020
so nice today?

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.570
Nice choice of words.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.060
You eat first. I'll wait for the second round.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:41.940
Don't worry.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.850
Hurry back.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.890
Stop hiding.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:54.850
Come out.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.330
Changhe,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.700
you seem to be enjoying life

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.500
in Nan'an City.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.650
When the mission's done,

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:05.810
let's all live comfortably together.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:07.570
Have you found them?

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.000
We sent out good trackers

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.420
in Blood River.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.350
After leaving Wushuang City,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.170
they split into two groups.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.290
One went to Tianqi City.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.610
It's reasonable

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.250
that the First Prince would return to Tianqi.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.900
We followed the trail Yu left

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.980
and found that the other group

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:24.860
had gone to Shuzhong.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:25.770
Shuzhong?

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.610
There's only one place worth going to there.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.900
The Tang Clan.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.690
The First Prince is colluding with the Tang Clan?

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.540
Isn't that the Tang Clan allied with the Prince of Langya?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.630
Not long ago,

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.770
Yumo sent back a message,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.800
saying that after Tang Lianyue returned to the Tang Clan,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.820
he vanished.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.730
She questioned Baixiao Hall,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.960
but none of them

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.820
knew anything.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.820
Changhe,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.090
we...

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.250
Let's go

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.020
to Jinyue Pastry.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.460
They sell nice osmanthus cake.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.130
I'll buy each of you a jin.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.540
Let's go.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.020
What's on your mind?

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.250
Thinking about your Yu again?

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.840
My Yu?

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.650
Don't talk nonsense.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.210
If I'm making it up,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.380
why are your ears red?

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.900
Since returning from Tianqi City,

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.570
you've been completely out of it.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.730
People might think

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.980
your soul

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.980
flew away with Su Muyu.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.730
You!

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.980
Don't hit me.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.170
I value my life.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.540
Yes, I like Yu.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.690
He's like the moon

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.020
in Blood River.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.420
Clear, cold,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.090
different from others.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.610
I've always thought that,

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.170
of all here in Blood River,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:11.420
aside from Yumo,

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.820
I'm the best match for him.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.340
So when I first saw Bai Hehuai

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.650
in Jiuxiao City,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.980
I really wanted to kill her.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.210
Not just for the mission,

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.690
I had personal reasons.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.820
She's

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.570
dazzling.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.540
Is she?

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.060
But when I met Yu

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.290
in Tianqi City,

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.250
he seemed

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.340
different.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.690
I realized

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.380
he could be so lively.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.900
So I watched them from afar

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.170
and felt happy for them.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.940
So...

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.020
are you moping

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.420
because you gave up on unrequited love?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.210
