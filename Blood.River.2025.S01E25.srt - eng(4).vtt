[Episode 25]

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.100
So I watched them from afar

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.410
and felt happy for them.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.380
So...

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.820
are you moping because you gave up on unrequited love?

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.660
- Can you ever stop talking? - Ow!

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.660
Poison...

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.290
Even the crows outside

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.240
sound better than you.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.820
I don't even know how they're doing

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.980
in Nan'an City.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.100
Where are they?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.850
They ate their fill,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.940
then headed back to the clinic.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.610
My girl even dragged the Medicine King along.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.850
She told me

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.780
to have you rush this flower cake

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.100
to the clinic for her.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.380
Waiter.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.940
Send it to He-Yu Clinic.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.690
Got it. Thanks, sir.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.410
What happened?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.690
We've got a lead.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.540
The First Prince went to Tianqi City.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.290
The others

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.380
went to the Tang Clan.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.220
Figures.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.660
Since they lost

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.540
in Wushuang City,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.610
they'd chase a new target.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.380
Never thought it'd be the Tang Clan.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.450
Tang Clan

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.380
is one of the clans most skilled

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.260
in poison and crooked arts.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.220
If Night Crow

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.220
goes there with a crew,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.500
this whole thing

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.540
won't be simple.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.170
Tang Clan is under the Prince of Langya's sway.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.220
The earlier hit

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.220
on Second Master Tang

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.820
was aimed at Tang Lianyue,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.130
the Prince of Langya's favorite.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.410
Maybe behind it all

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.730
stands the First Prince.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.660
So,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.130
what's it got to do with us?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.500
Yumo is still digging

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.380
into the Tang Clan.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.540
Give her a little time.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.060
We'll work on something else for now,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.610
Su Muyu.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.660
We promised Blood River's folks

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.540
we'd lead them to the Other Shore.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.020
How do you think

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.490
about Nan'an City?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.810
Founding our sect here,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.410
some folks won't like it.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.700
Leave that to me.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.580
Sure thing.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.410
If it's on me,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.020
I'll cut down anyone

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.170
who says no across Nan'an City.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.980
Then I'm out of it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.580
Master Su.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.980
What brings you all here together?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.340
Who hurt you,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.290
Changli?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.170
Xuewei and I had just reached Nan'an City

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.220
when we saw

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.700
Lingxiao Sect disciples

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.460
throwing Changli out.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.250
We were going

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.340
to teach them a lesson.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.410
Xuewei even had her Poison Palm

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.410
raised already.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.660
But Changli said

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.810
you and the Patriarch ordered

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.980
no taking lives.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.580
Changhe and Master Su

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.020
sent me to find a prime site.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.950
A broker pointed me

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.510
to an estate plot with great views and terrain,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.410
perfect for a manor.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.660
But it belongs to the Lingxiao Sect.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.630
A few of their disciples

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.730
somehow got wind of it,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.100
and saw through me at a glance

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.930
that I was of Blood River.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.580
They said Blood River isn't welcome in Nan'an City.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.840
They won't mind

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.290
so long as we lie low and stay quiet.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.810
But if we want to settle openly,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.050
they'll be the first to block it.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.100
They also said...

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.780
Blood River rats creeping toward the light?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.490
Aren't you afraid

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.170
you'll be wiped out?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.050
You must be Master Su.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.900
By my master's order,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.540
I came after Blood River's disciples.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.540
Sorry to intrude.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.340
Never thought

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.250
you really couldn't show your faces,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.020
holed up in a clinic.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.170
Blood River isn't what it used to be.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.640
Now we plan to found anew

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.290
and scrap the old in Nan'an City.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.930
Will Lingxiao Sect forbid it?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.540
Most plots belong to rich families,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.370
and Lingxiao Sect and Daffodil House

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.140
are close with those households.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.020
So we won't let them

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.140
sell Blood River an inch.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.100
Our master says

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.730
Blood River has too much blood on its hands.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.700
And Nan'an's too small a place,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.730
no room for killing fiends like you.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.540
Muyu, what's going on?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.850
Hongxi and Ziyi are both here

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.930
to treat their wounds.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.020
Su Changli,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.220
you're hurt too?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.410
Come with me.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.250
I'll dress it.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.220
Okay.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.490
So you brought us

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.540
to Nan'an on purpose

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.930
for this, huh?

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.970
You're really planning

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.850
to found a sect here?

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.730
Not exactly easy.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.780
Had I known,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.170
I'd have swapped with Uncle Qidao.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.490
He's a family head too.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.210
As for me,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.280
I'd stay with Xuewei

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.340
to hold Blood River,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.100
and let him handle this.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.660
Forget it.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.220
If he came,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.410
he'd chop them all in one go.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.080
- Farewell. - Take care.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.410
Wait.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.900
Mr. Su,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.020
I know you're connected to the miracle physician

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.220
at He-Yu Clinic.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.370
I'm not making things hard,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.280
but Lingxiao Sect

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.630
and Daffodil House have ordered

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.900
no land can be sold to you.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.340
If you truly need a plot,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.250
you might ask around

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.340
at Changsheng Sect's base.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.580
Changsheng Sect?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.050
This sect

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.100
isn't a local power.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.100
They came from Sihuai City.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.690
Sure,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.170
you can't fight City Hall.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.900
Yet this Changsheng Sect

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160
still tore a chunk

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.490
from Lingxiao Sect

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.660
and Daffodil House.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.100
Now,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.040
the parcels in Nan'an City

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.540
outside those two factions' control

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.410
are all in their hands.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.050
Thanks.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:26.730
Stop!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.170
Made a scene in our place?

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.410
Get him!

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:34.980
Stop!

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.010
Who is he?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.370
Who are you?

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.980
He's just a kid.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.890
Why hit him so hard?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.220
You promised

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.530
if I won the ring,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.490
the prize would be mine.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.940
Why break your word?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.770
You're just an inn waiter.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.980
How could you possibly beat

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.250
our sect's expert?

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.060
Yeah!

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.850
You must have cheated.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.460
Come explain yourself back with us.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.580
Who stays a waiter for life?

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.820
I won on my own.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.010
I know.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.340
Sir,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.300
stop meddling...

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.770
The lowest courage

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.490
comes from anger.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.370
Incredible!

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.940
No way...

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.610
Wasn't he just standing still there?

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.220
Then how did our blades break?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.610
I just felt

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.800
a surge of powerful inner force...

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.980
Who's making trouble here?

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.730
- Sir. - Sir.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.850
What's going on?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.340
Who broke their blades?

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.300
I did.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.980
Who are you?

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.980
Where'd you come from.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.770
Ge Xiu.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.440
You little punk.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.300
How dare you call me by name?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.770
You want to die?

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.180
Oh, wait...

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.530
How do you know my real name?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.180
This is Ge Changsheng,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.420
Master of Changsheng Sect.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.770
Three years since Heishui Stronghold,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.700
looks like you've grown.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.420
You...

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:23.980
you're...

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.700
Well...

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.580
just a misunderstanding.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.220
If it's a misunderstanding,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.100
why are their blades still raised?

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.010
Insolent!

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.460
- You're insolent! - Insolent!

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.220
Stop...

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:38.820
No...

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:39.850
Uh...

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.890
I... I didn't mean you.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.100
I meant them.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.340
Are you lot stupid?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.180
Are you stupid, huh?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.890
Put the blades away, now!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.850
Got it.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:49.890
Uh...

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.650
What's with this situation?

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.080
I failed to discipline my men.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.940
Don't take offense.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.180
I heard you were the bully of Sihuai City.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.010
But this is Nan'an City.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.770
You know this place so well too?

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.100
Let's talk privately.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.370
As it happens,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.650
I need your help with something.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.200
Back then, thanks to you sparing me,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.130
I kept my life,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.530
and Changsheng Sect exists today.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.610
Back then,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.220
you worked at Heishui Stronghold,

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.420
yet saved many innocents.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.700
You earned that life yourself.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.340
Enough of the past.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.490
Let's talk about what I mentioned.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.560
Starting

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.480
a new Blood River in Nan'an City

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.420
is actually..

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.390
a hard sell.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.500
Right now in Nan'an,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.650
we can't find a single broker

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.300
willing to sell us land.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.100
Still,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.460
since I'm handling business here

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.820
and happened to meet you,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.820
this matter

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.060
is on me!

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.100
I promise,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.300
first thing tomorrow,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.130
the deed

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.250
will be delivered to your clinic.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.340
Then I'll trouble you.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.730
Much appreciated.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.770
Don't mention it!

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.250
What is this crappy array,

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.850
like a turtle shell?

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.180
I can't find a single weak spot.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.300
I invented this formation.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.940
It even blocks your poison.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.370
For the moment,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.730
no flaw to be found.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:49.770
No.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.530
I found a flaw.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.610
What's it?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.650
Put away this turtle shell first,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.320
and I'll tell you.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.340
What flaw?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.960
I'm dead.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.000
I'm dead.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.340
I'm dead...

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.890
Quit acting.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.580
I didn't even touch you.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.850
You were ready for that move.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.180
I just wanted to make you laugh.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.370
Xuewei,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.700
what do you think?

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.010
My formation

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.010
with your poison,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.100
how is it?

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.300
If so...

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.720
Muyu,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.570
you done talking?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.370
Done.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.850
So,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.930
when are we moving Blood River's base

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.700
to this city?

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.260
Or maybe we should

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.940
simply move the clinic into Blood River?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.220
What a rotten idea.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.980
You want patients coming into Blood River

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.010
to see the miracle physician?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:47.890
Who would come?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.820
That problem

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.610
might be solved by morning.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:00.080
[He-Yu Clinic]

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.300
The Changsheng folks aren't here yet?

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.180
Not yet.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.460
It's already noon.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.030
Did Ge Changsheng

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.300
go back on his word?

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.770
Wait a bit more.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:08.700
Mr. Su!

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.950
Early this morning,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.300
a bunch of officials showed up

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.850
and seized Master Ge.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.890
I barely managed to escape.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.070
They said

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.940
Master Ge killed the Prefect's son.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.340
What?

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.100
When it rains,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.460
it pours.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.700
I know what you're about to do.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.490
What did you find?

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.490
Ge Changsheng,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.850
Sihuai City's infamous scoundrel,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.250
Master of Changsheng Sect.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.460
This time,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.340
he had an antiques deal with the Prefect's son,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.180
and the deal was sealed.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.060
That was last night.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.100
Last night?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.700
Ge Changsheng

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.700
did only two things.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.700
First,

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.460
he secured

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.650
the deed to Shanxiu Manor,

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.180
which should be

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.340
what he promised you yesterday.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.610
Second,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.300
he went to the Prefect's residence to trade.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.770
But not long after he left,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.060
the Prefect's son was found

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.180
dead in his room.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.370
Ge Changsheng

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.530
became the prime suspect.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.180
The enraged Prefect

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.130
has thrown him in jail.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.140
Buns!

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.270
Fresh hot pork buns!

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.850
Halt.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.010
You again.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.980
Master Su,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.980
if you take Blood River

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.060
and leave Nan'an City,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.530
Ge Changsheng

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.530
will be released from prison.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.130
That's Lingxiao Sect's position?

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.060
Naturally.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.220
We'll let Ge Changsheng go.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.220
But,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.420
Blood River and Changsheng Sect

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.850
must get out of Nan'an City.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.630
Daffodil House

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.370
is already posted at Changsheng Sect's base.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.650
They're of the same mind.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.700
So you two have teamed up.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.300
That's right.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.890
If you know what's good for you,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.700
then right now...

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.530
You're not qualified to talk to me.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.620
What about me?

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.130
You...

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.530
That's Lingxiao Sect's Master.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.980
Am I qualified

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.530
to speak with you?

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.250
One block from here

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.370
is the Prefect's residence.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.420
You want to see the Prefect?

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.250
Su Muyu, are you crazy?

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.460
You're not qualified either.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.250
He-Yu Clinic wishes

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.650
to assist the Prefect

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.180
in examining the young master's body.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.580
Sachets! Pendants! Take a look!

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.180
Who are you?

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.890
I hear your young master is dead,

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.850
and the killer's a man of the martial world.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.490
So what if he is?

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.850
Are you here to plead

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.770
for the killer?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.060
He deserves death

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.390
a thousand times over!

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.420
What if I prove he isn't the killer?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.130
What did you say?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.850
The miracle physician's just recovered.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.850
Sir, please,

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.890
come with me to the clinic.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.420
Sir, may I ask

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.090
the cause of his death?

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.850
The dagger in his chest

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.050
was Ge Changsheng's cherished blade.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.530
Isn't it obvious

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.570
Ge killed him with it?

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.530
Ruling by a dagger alone

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.900
is a bit hasty,

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.900
isn't it?

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.700
Quite right.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.050
He didn't die of a blade.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.490
Someone poisoned his wine.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.900
That dagger was thrust into his chest

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.980
after he died.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.180
And you are?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.290
I've long heard

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.490
of the miracle physician's name.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.490
But earlier,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.250
the coroner examined the body

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.050
and found

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.530
no sign of poison.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:51.940
That's because

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.700
it wasn't ordinary poison.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.940
It was the Soul-Draining Pill.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.900
With this toxin,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.620
even the heart keeps beating

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.620
after death,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.770
looking normal.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.180
But the brain

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.450
has already been eaten clean

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.770
by corpse-worms.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.420
So your coroner

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.220
couldn't tell,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.010
and assumed

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.010
the knife was driven in while he lived.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.330
You can open the skull and check.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.180
But mind

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.460
the corpse-worms.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.140
If they bite you,

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.140
you'll have to wait for my junior

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.330
to return from the mountain with herbs

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.220
to save you.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.010
I'm not good

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.250
with these disgusting things.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.490
In Nan'an City,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.050
which sect is best with poison?

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.770
Go check now!

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.460
Understood!

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.140
Sorry.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.530
What are you sorry for, sir?

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.380
Without you,

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.490
they'd have framed me,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.810
tortured me to death.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:38.940
By the way,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.980
I've got you

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.330
the deed you wanted.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.660
I even found

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.330
a fine location.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.530
Thanks...

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.010
but keep it.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.140
What?

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.900
The Prefect's son was killed

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.460
by Lingxiao Sect and Daffodil House.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.700
They'll pay for it.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.900
If I hadn't asked you

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.180
to help me,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.090
they wouldn't have framed you

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.620
for failing to beat Blood River.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.620
Oh...

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.620
If we don't have

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.730
strong enough backing,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.530
trying to walk in the light

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.660
will only bring more obstacles,

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.090
and even drag down

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.980
those who help us.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.010
This time it's just two Nan'an sects.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.140
If we truly found a sect,

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.490
the whole Jiangnan

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.420
would start to stir.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.810

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.770
I'm heading out on a long trip.

Changhe,

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.010
any word from Yumo on the Tang Clan?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.490
None.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.520
What's up?

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.140
Tang Clan

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.620
might be our opening.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.810
Our opening?

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.250
You want an alliance with the Tang Clan?

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.360
I've thought it through.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.940
They're the best fit.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.140
They're a major sect,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.530
but work in hidden weapons and poison.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.730
When they were founded,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.460
the world wouldn't accept them,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.140

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.810
Also,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.770

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.860
Night Crow tied to the First Prince

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.050
headed toward the Tang Clan.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.420
Night Crow practices the drugged puppet craft.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.140
There's a scheme behind it,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.900
maybe even

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.940

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.460
may win a shot at alliance,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.900
maybe even

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.770
build some link to the Prince of Langya?

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.090
What?

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.770
So Blood River ends up on the imperial payroll?

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.570
How's that different from the Shadow Sect before?

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.140
The Prince of Langya is different.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.900

walking streets like this at night

is dangerous.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.140
It's Start of Autumn today.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.380
We should eat eggplant.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.660
I plan to cook myself.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.810
Farewell!

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.710
Farewell...

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.050
Muyu,

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.620
did you...

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.660
get the eggplants?

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.770
Yeah.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.090
Fresh?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.050
Fresh.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.220
Store-bought hot food

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.140
is never as healthy as home-cooked.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.980
Su Muyu,

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.620
are you cooking again?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.570
That's the Start-of-Autumn custom.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.940
Custom?

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.330
What custom?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.530
Eat eggplant on Start of Autumn.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.860
Keep away from the kitchen!

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.980
Give it to me!

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.530
Return the groceries!

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.010
- Just an eggplant dish. - No!

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.120
Trust me,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.290
nothing will go wrong!

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:41.940
Like hell I believe that!

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.400
I've developed a new recipe.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.010
Come on, return it!

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.380
Give it back to me...

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.250
It would be wonderful

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.980
if Changhe were here,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.250
and we could just eat out.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.250
About Tang Lianyue,

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.490
are you sure he never left Shuzhong

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.050
after he returned to the Tang Clan?

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.290
To be precise,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.010
he hasn't stepped past

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.530
the Tang Clan gate.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.220
He's the Xuanwu Guardian,

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.580
no court post,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.860
but charged with guarding Tianqi.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.400
Yet he went back and never came out.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.810
Interesting.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.010
So...

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.620
Something must've happened.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.380
Let's go to the Tang Clan to propose.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.980
How about it?

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.330
Really?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.460
Of course.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.660
This trip to the Tang Clan

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.530
is very important.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.700
At least to Su Muyu,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.250
it is.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.570
Say it.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.220
Besides that,

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.050
what else?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.700
Muyu says

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.180
the ghost physician studying drugged puppet went to the Tang Clan.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.050
And there's a plot behind it,

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.290
very likely aimed

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.460
at the Prince of Langya.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.330
And I think

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.900
Tang Lianyue is close to the Prince of Langya.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.250
If we get on with the Tang Clan,

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.730
we get on with the Prince of Langya.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.250
In the jianghu,

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.500
one more friend, one less risk.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.220
If we want to walk in the sunlight,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.220
we can't do it without friends.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:07.330
Qingyang.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.490
You and Xuewei have been to Shuzhong before.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.620
You two go scout ahead this time.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.380
As you command, Sir.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.490
This time,

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.700
you need to help our Miss Mu

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:45.730
pull off something big.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.730
Don't let your guard down.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:49.940
In the jianghu,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.530
few places are more dangerous,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.940
Tang Clan is one of them.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.380
If I let my guard down,

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.090
I might never make it back.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.140
But I already wrote to Tang Linghuang,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.700
hoping to ally with them

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.250
in Blood River's name.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.090
Why choose them?

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.330
If Blood River is to stand tall,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.180
we need a powerful ally

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.090
behind us.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.700
Tang Clan

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.010
has long been misunderstood.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.460
Maybe they'll understand us.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.380
Tang Clan...

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.090
are they that formidable?

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.050
Their hidden weapons are first under heaven,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.900
their poisons second.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.700
Tang Fort is riddled with traps,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.980
a lion's den.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.980
Then who ranks first

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.620
in poisons?

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.220
The Wen clan, of course.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.770
Fine.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.380
Then let me,

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.860
a direct heir of the Wen clan

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.330
that outclasses Tang Clan in poison,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.620
give you a gift.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.980
It'll keep you

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.940
unafraid of the Tang Clan.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.330
What is it this time?

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.570
Come out, Green.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.250
Cute, right?

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.530
Compared to Yumo's spiders,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.330
definitely cuter.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.900
Thank you.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.900
It's a Jade Serpent

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.420
from the southwest.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.700
They say

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.290
it likes to coil on jade,

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.570
so its body

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.370
slowly took on a jade-like hue.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:20.530
By the way,

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.700
have you been to Mian City in the southwest?

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.140
No.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.940
Pity.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.490
It's a fascinating place.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.860
One cut makes you rich, one cut leaves you broke,

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.660
and one cut shrouds you in mourning white.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.010
There are

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.860
mountains of rough stones.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:36.620
Split them open,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.420
maybe you'll find pure imperial green,

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.700
or maybe

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.490
just dull, chalk-white rock.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.530
Su Changhe's loaded.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.570
How about

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.980
we trick him into going there?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.420
Changhe's too sharp.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.290
I can't fool him.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:53.570
Fine.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.140
Then keep this on you.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.900
If you

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.980
get poisoned,

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.490
just let it

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.420
bite you once.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.940
Can it counter the poison?

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:03.940
No.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.290
It's venomous head to tail,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.180
kills as soon as it meets blood.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.940
Kills on contact?

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:10.980
Yes.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.980
Its venom is peculiar.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.250
When it meets another poison,

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.730
the two create

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.570
a strange counteracting effect.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.220
If you're poisoned by one,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.530
then let this Jade Serpent

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.220
bite you.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.940
The poisons will counter each other,

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.490
ensuring you

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.700
won't die from it

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.860
for at least ten days.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.660
If you're poisoned,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.700
let it bite you.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.900
Then rush back

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.700
and find me at once.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.050
I'll detox you.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.460
Got it?

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.570
Got it.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.290
But how do I care for it?

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.860
By then,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.180
Ms. Yumo will be with you, right?

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.810
Just have her

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.330
toss a few spiders in

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:46.940
each day.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.420
Okay.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.290
Su Muyu,

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.330
tell me,

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.140
what does it take

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.530
to reach Blood River's Other Shore?

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:04.900
At first,

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.090
you thought

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.010
to reach that Other Shore,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.630
you only had to topple

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.140
the old Blood River families.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:13.960
Later,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.220
you beat the three former family heads,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.700
founded a new Blood River.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.700
But you found

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.290
behind Blood River,

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.570
another hand was pulling strings.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.490
So you went to Tianqi City,

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.810
defeated Shadow Sect,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.490
burned their tower,

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.290
and became

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.900
a Blood River completely free.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.660
But now,

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.220
you're heading for the Tang Clan

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.900
to face new enemies.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:40.770
You and I both know,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.700
Tang Clan...

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.660
may not be the end.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.740
♪Who can ford this river of night...♪

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.980
It seems

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.330
that fabled Other Shore

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.090
is forever out of reach.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.180
Like when you were in Nan'an City,

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.860
seemed to live a quiet life,

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.290
yet still

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.420
had to return to Blood River.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.010
Then let's hope it's the end this time.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.490
All right.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.420
I'll wait here in Nan'an City

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.700
for your return.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.420
Senior, you're still the same,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.740
sharp as ever.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.940
I set this trap for so long,

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.380
waiting here to poison you,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.170
yet you still saw through it.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.860
Night Crow,

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.170
you finally show yourself!

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.780
Senior,

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.610
after all these years,

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.050
you remember me at last.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.610
You've chased me so long.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.130
What do you want?

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.420
Back then, you stole from me

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.380
the drugged puppet craft.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.050
I took it back,

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.530
and you swore to stop.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.570
But you broke your word.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.340
My Senior says

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.860
you didn't just keep studying it,

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.780
you even began refining the living!

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.980
That's the greatest taboo of Medicine King Valley!

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.340
As this generation's Medicine King,

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.260
I must purge our house!

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.420
Using the living to forge drugged puppet...

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.340
Is this what you mean?

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.260
You want to fight me?

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.780
You're the one who won't let me go.
