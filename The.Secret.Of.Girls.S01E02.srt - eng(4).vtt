"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 2)

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.280
You can put it here first.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.149
From 7PM to 7AM is the night shift.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.590
Which is handled by male colleagues.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.789
You are mainly responsible
for the morning shift.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.030
From 7AM to 7PM.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.910
Then what does my work usually involve?

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.830
In the morning, you just
need to clean the courtyard.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.150
Drying towels, sheets and quilt covers.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.630
When guests check out at noon,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.270
you have to clean and tidy up the room.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.030
Replace toiletries.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.189
Guests usually check in in the afternoon.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.590
You need to assist guests in checking in.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.950
Lead them to the room.

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.870
And handle guests' emergency needs.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.510
What are the guests' emergency needs?

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.830
There's plenty.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.830
For example:

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.989
If guests are not satisfied with the room,
you need to change it.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.030
If the equipment is damaged,
you need to replace it.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.350
Or.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.310
The guests have a physical
condition or feel sick.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.870
OK

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.029
Or.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.710
Some idiot lost their wallet,
their phone, or something like that.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.990
Let's keep this professional on work.

00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.870
Lets avoid personal attacks, Okay?

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.550
I'm not.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.630
I'm just stating objective facts.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.030
This is my room.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.190
It's so big.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.910
Is this really for me to live in?

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.749
There are not many employees in the inn.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.310
Most of the senior employees
are locals and will go home to stay.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.989
These two rooms are
reserved for temporary budget travelers.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.230
But they will work part-time
and travel at the same time

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.870
of course.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.950
During peak season when we're fully booked,
we still arrange accommodations for guests.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.870
That's really great.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.190
Great?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.510
Yes.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.510
This is way bigger than my rental place.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.230
Fine.

00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:10.590
You will start to work tomorrow.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.550
I have a question.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.530
Didn't you just say that food and
accommodation are included?

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:16.830
So about the food...

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.629
Breakfast will be bought by colleagues
who get off the night shift.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.549
The meal time for lunch
and dinner isn't fixed.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.950
It depends on whether you are busy.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.829
I have another question.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.990
You have so many questions.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.110
This is a very serious question.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.790
Didn't I just tell you
that I lost my phone?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.110
If there is no alarm
clock, I might oversleep.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.270
Don't worry about this

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.070
I will wake you up on time at 6:30.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.710
Okay.

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.230
Okay, bring the luggage in and pack it up.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.110
We have all had dinner.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.030
Go out and eat something by
yourself with the money I gave you.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.910
Wait a minute.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.469
Can you do me a favor?

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.990
Can you help me order some takeout?

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.230
I will give you the money.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.070
Sis.

00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:55.630
It seems that the money is mine.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.630
No.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.430
It's just

00:05:57.431 --> 00:05:59.429
I've been exhausted all day

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.190
I really don't want to move.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.070
Call me mom.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.790
Why should I call you mom?

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.590
You are not my mom.

00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.790
Yes, I am not your mom.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.030
God treats me unfairly.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.910
Why do you always pick on the weakest one?

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.110
Who could be more
miserable than me right now?

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.110
What's wrong with you? Do you need help?

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.950
I'll help you find someone who works here.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.190
Let's go.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.669
Are you okay? Where is it?

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.670
It hurts so much.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.870
It hurts so much.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.950
Well that's just great.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.230
I lost everything valuable.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.590
My phone's gone.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.390
The money is gone.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.150
God know if someone's gonna kidnap me
and harvest my kidneys.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.429
My kidneys are fine.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.070
You can't harvest my kidneys.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.110
I have nothing left.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.310
Not even a lover.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.150
What's good about dating?

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.670
That's not something a poor
flop like you needs to worry about.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.710
I'm poor.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.550
You're the flop.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.389
Xu Jingxi.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.590
You are really “successful”.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.110
And I ran into someone so
sour-faced who wants to be my mom.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.390
I am so done with it.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.509
Crazy.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.510
Who?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.510
Sourpuss.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.350
What are you doing?

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.710
Sourpuss.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.630
I want to ask you a very serious question.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.430
Have you ever been in a relationship?

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.190
You drank too much.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.110
YOU drank too much.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.190
I didn't drink too much.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.630
Oh my God.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.910
Hey.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.390
What?

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.150
Hey.

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.230
What are you doing?

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.470
Can you get up?

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.070
It hurts.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.110
God, with a tolerance this low,
why even drink?

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.350
Sooner or later your
kidneys will be harvested.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.430
Kowtow.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.790
I wanna drink more.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.670
Sis.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.310
If you drink again, I'll kill you.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.430
Go.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.270
Go.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.270
Lift your legs.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.750
I shouldn't have been
soft-hearted and let you stay.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.270
Sourpuss, you're here.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.830
Sit down.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.070
Actually, looking at you like this.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.870
You are so beautiful.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.750
When I see you.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.190
I thought...

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.770
What did you think?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.350
I think I want to throw up.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.470
Who is it?

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.630
Are you awake?
Miss Poor.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.590
Who's poor?

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.670
You said it.

00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:00.390
You're poor, I'm a flop.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.030
What the hell?

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.190
You don't remember?

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.990
What should I remember?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.510
Nevermind.

00:11:08.844 --> 00:11:10.470
It's 6:30, you only have half an hour.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.070
Put this on after you wash up.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.550
Look for me at the front desk.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.126
Why are you making such a stinky face
so early in the morning.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.510
Seems like someone owes you money.

00:11:23.782 --> 00:11:25.302
Oh, someone really does owe her money.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.070
Sis Wen Shan.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.429
These are some of
requirements from the guests.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.430
Take a look.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.750
OK

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.349
Then these are the keys
for checking out today

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.350
I've put them here.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.750
Hello.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.470
Hello, beautiful lady.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.950
Good morning.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.310
My name is Xu Jingxi

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.030
I'll be working in the inn from today.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.950
This name.

00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:50.109
Sounds really beautiful.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.790
Thank you.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.470
Just call me Xiaoyu

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.790
I mostly work night shifts.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.550
You call everyone beautiful lady.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.670
Sis Wen Shan, I'm clocking out now.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.150
Bye, beautiful lady, see you tonight.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.670
Bye bye.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.990
So, what should I do now?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.790
Does the clothes fit well?

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.070
It's fine.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.750
Let's go.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.430
This way.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.950
Have you seen enough?

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.069
Sheets, quilt covers, towels.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.590
The cleaning company delivers them
every morning after washing.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.670
And you.

00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:39.830
Dry them out.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.710
That's your task.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.350
There's so much!

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.230
Do you do chores at home?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.470
Do I look that delicate?

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.550
Yes.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.469
If you don't roast me once per sentence.
You'll get sick, right?

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.150
I'm just telling the truth.

00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:01.605
Okay, stop talking.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.630
Do it.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.790
And these.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.790
Won't you help me?
