00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
(Presents)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.360
(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.680
I promise

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.240
I’ll take good care of you.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
Surprise.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640
Krit.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640
I like you, May.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840
Leave me alone.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360
Do you realize

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.640
you’re making me
more and more uncomfortable, Pat?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.560
Don’t worry about anything.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880
Forget everything.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Because this is your life, May.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840
Pat.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.840
Can we postpone

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.760
our wedding?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.000
Why?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.760
Are you still mad at me?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240
I'm so sorry

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.760
for making you uncomfortable.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840
I'm not mad at you.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.520
So why do you want to postpone it?
I'm sorry.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.120
I’m stressing you out, aren’t I?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Last night,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.840
I just did what I felt like doing.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.000
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.800
It’s my fault

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.720
for not being clear with Pat.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800
What do you mean?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.320
It would've been great

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920
if I’d chosen
to be with you back then.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
Come on, May.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.080
Don’t say that.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.280
You’re marrying Pat.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.600
Just forget

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.240
about last night.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.080
If you still love him,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.360
I want you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.120
to go back to him.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.880
But if you want me
to take responsibility,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920
I’d be happy to.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.120
Can we not postpone the wedding?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.480
I’ve been waiting for ages.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360
I’m so sorry for making you
uncomfortable.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.560
I promise I’ll change.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.400
We're just not compatible.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.520
Are you breaking up with me again?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440
No.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.960
I love you, May. I'm sorry.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.480
I promise I’ll do better.
I’ll try to understand your work.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.920
I won’t make you uncomfortable.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.320
It’s not just that, Pat.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
May, but...

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.120
Our wedding is coming up.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.080
We’ve prepared almost everything.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.200
The invitations are already out.
What are we going to tell them?

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.960
May, I love you.
Please don’t postpone it.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.400
Please calm down.
Think about it, okay?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.320
Aoy and Chod.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.720
I’m too scared
to tell him the real reason.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.360
I want to break up with him
because of Krit.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.160
So I decided
to postpone my decision,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.400
instead of the wedding.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.440
Are you stressed?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480
No.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.520
I'm just stressed about work.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.760
If you're worried about meeting up

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.360
or upset about seeing me now,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840
just tell me.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.880
Forget about work.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.200
I’m willing to consult someone else.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.600
It’s not like that.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
Did you tell Pat

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.560
that I’m your client?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720
No, I didn’t.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.520
Did you ever tell him

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.440
that I asked you

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.160
to be my girlfriend back then?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.080
No, I didn’t.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640
Then...

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.640
there’s nothing to worry about.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.560
No one will find out about us.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.640
Pat would never suspect me.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240
Okay, Krit.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920
There’s one more thing

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.200
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.840
I want to ask you to be my partner
at the bar.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.600
You’d just need to invest,
I’ll handle the rest.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.760
You don’t have to do anything
but some marketing advice.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.040
You’ve already done so much
for me for free.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.440
So I thought you should get shares
and dividends as a reward.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920
Would you be interested?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.840
That sounds interesting.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.160
Thank you for trusting me.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440
Pat?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.200
What are you doing here?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.200
I’m applying for a job
at your company.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.240
Instead of freelancing
for someone else,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.600
I’ll help you.
So I'll understand the work better.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.840
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040
Why not?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
Well...

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.320
It would be nice to have
Pat help out.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.280
Krit.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600
Hello.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.240
Long time no see.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.160
What are you doing here?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.360
May’s helping with my bar’s
promotional plans.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.200
I see.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.600
Having Pat help would be great.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.480
We might get
some good ideas from him.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760
May.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.680
Thank you

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.240
for letting me help out.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.080
I have something to tell you.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.440
No matter what you do,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.640
I’ll always support you.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760
I’m sorry

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.560
for making you feel like
I don’t care about your work.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Thank you.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.840
We haven’t
spent much time together lately.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560
Tonight...

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.320
you don’t have any urgent work,
do you?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880
Pat.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
What's wrong?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.960
Maybe next time.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.680
I'm exhausted.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.480
That’s not true.
You’ve been acting strange lately.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.360
Are you getting bored with me?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560
I...

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520
May.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.240
Please.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.040
Please, give me a chance
to make things right.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.520
I love you so much.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.520
Aoy and Chod, all I feel
for Pat right now is pity.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.160
So I decided to buy some more time

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.880
before making a decision

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.160
in a way I never thought I could.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.720
So, do you like it?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.400
It’s nice.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.080
You moving in

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.240
makes this house so much nicer.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.960
Then we don’t need
to look for a new place.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.480
Just me moving in
makes it feel perfect already.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280
May.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.160
Once we get married,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680
do you want to have kids?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.480
What about you?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Of course I do.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.080
I’m so jealous of my friends
with cute kids.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.480
I really want one too.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.880
If we’re going to have one,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.880
would you want a son or a daughter?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.160
It doesn't matter.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.280
- Really?
- Yes.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.240
Then...

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320
What?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.960
Should we start making one now?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.400
What are you talking about?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.720
Let’s make a baby.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.240
- Pat.
- Where should we do it?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.480
Hey.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.080
- Right here.
- Hey!

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560
Pat.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680
What?

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.840
- Hey.
- What?

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960
Come on.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.040
- We're going to make one now.
- No.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.720
(Maple Forte
Emergency Contraceptive Tablet)

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.720
- May.
- Pat.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440
Do you want to go to the office now?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.200
We’re working together,
so we should go together.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.440
If you’re tired,
you can nap while I drive.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.840
Let’s go separately.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.760
I have to meet clients.
It’s more convenient that way.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.440
Okay.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040
Sure.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.720
I’ll go get ready.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.160
Okay.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960
Emergency contraceptive tablet?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.680
Good, a Halloween party
to help promote the bar.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.680
That sounds really interesting.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.760
That’s right.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.400
It was actually Pat’s idea.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.960
Really?

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.840
Pat.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.480
I really like this idea.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720
Pat.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.560
Pat.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.200
- Yes?
- I said, I really like your idea.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.680
A Halloween party
to promote the bar.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840
Great job.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360
Thank you.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.440
But I’m really surprised.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.560
You’re not a party person, are you?

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.440
I get it.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.040
You were probably inspired
by Sexy May.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520
Oh.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.120
Not really.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640
How about this?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.040
I’d like to invite everyone
to my bar tonight,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.560
so you can get to know it better.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.720
Don’t worry, it’s on me.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.600
Drink some, Pat.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.720
Please, go ahead.
I don’t drink much.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.400
He doesn’t drink.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.040
He also doesn’t like parties.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.120
At the last company party,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.600
Pat came to bring May home.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.440
Really?

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.160
Well...

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.400
I know May and I are very different.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.160
It might even seem like
we're incompatible.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.600
Sometimes I make her uncomfortable,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.520
but I’m ready to change for her.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.200
- It's fine, Pat.
- No, it's okay.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280
Krit.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.120
Cheers.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.520
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.800
- More.
- More.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.120
Cheers.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.840
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.200
- More.
- Cheers.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200
Cheers.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960
Bottoms up.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640
That's enough, Pat.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840
Go ahead, Pat.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920
Are you okay?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.440
I need to use the bathroom.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.600
- I’ll check up on him.
- No, I’ll go.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.960
Oh no, Pat! Are you okay?

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.600
Why did you do that?

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680
Let me help.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.400
I just wanted
to adjust myself to you.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.680
I don’t want you to get bored.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.880
You know I love you
and I want to marry you.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.120
I want to start a family with you

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600
and have kids with you.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.280
Do you still want to marry me?

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.800
Why are you asking me that?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.080
Are you okay?

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.200
You’ve been acting strange
since this morning.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.960
I saw it.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.520
The box of the contraceptive tablet
you took.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.800
Don’t you want to have kids
with me anymore?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.520
Do you not want
to marry me anymore?

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.560
Tell me.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.120
- May.
- Pat.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.920
Let’s not talk about this now.
Let’s go home.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.720
Come on. Let me help.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.160
- I'll help.
- Thank you.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480
Pat.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.600
Let's go, Pat.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.120
He’s trying hard to change for you,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.720
but sometimes it feels like

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.120
he’s forcing it.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080
I was the same way.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.720
I tried to change for an ex,
but it didn’t work out.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.280
Maybe it could work for you two.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.600
But if it really doesn’t work,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.560
I want you to think carefully.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.080
Marriage

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.080
is a big deal.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.400
If you decide to marry him,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.320
you’ll have to live
with him forever.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.280
The more I talk,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.440
the more I’m stressing you out.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280
I'm sorry.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.680
No matter what happens,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.640
I’ll be here.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.160
You can always call me
and talk to me

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.760
about anything that’s bothering you.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.360
Thank you.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280
May.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.560
Thank you.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680
And...

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720
I'm sorry.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.840
I won’t pressure you again.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.240
If you’re not ready to have a kid,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.000
we can wait until you are.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.200
Don’t change for me,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.080
because I’ll change for you.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.440
Can you stay with me for a while?

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.200
We don’t get to do this often.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.320
You’re always so busy.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880
Here, Krit.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.040
Power of attorney documents
and the check for five million baht.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.600
(Signature: Maysa)

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.400
Thank you for trusting me.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.920
Does Pat know
you’re going to be my partner?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.960
I didn’t tell him.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.320
We don’t see eye to eye on things.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.480
If I tell him and he disagrees,
we’ll just end up fighting.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120
Okay.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.200
I'm glad we're partners.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680
Likewise.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360
Pat.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.720
Are you okay?

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280
Yes.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.080
I had a great caretaker last night.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.960
I'm jealous.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.200
I’m here to say that
the script for your video is done.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.960
I sent you an email.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.680
Take a look
and let me know if anything’s off.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480
It's fine.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.920
I trust you.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.920
May’s taking care of it too,
so I’m not worried.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.680
Let's get started then.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.280
We’ve got a special drink
for you tonight.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.160
Sexy May will be joining us as well.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.800
This drink is really fiery.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.560
It’s called the Flaming Lamborghini.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.880
Let’s see what’s hotter,

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.000
the drink or Sexy May.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.760
Let's get started.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.160
Please put this over there.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840
This glass.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.480
And...

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.960
Then this one.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.960
No.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360
Flip it.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.200
Like this.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440
That's right.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.240
Then this one.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.040
That's right. Flip it over.
And then...

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.400
Flip this one too.
Yes, just like that.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.640
And the last step.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.960
This step is really important

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.400
because it’ll make our drink

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.600
even more fiery.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.240
I’m sure

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.840
Sexy May will like this

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.880
because

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.720
she likes to play with fire.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120
Am I right?

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640
May!

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.920
Pat, fire!

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400
Pat. Are you okay?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.120
Call an ambulance.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.040
Pat, put out the fire.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640
Are you okay?

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.920
You shouldn’t have done that.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920
Come on.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.400
If I hadn’t, you would’ve been hurt.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160
Thank you.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680
You don’t have to thank me.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.680
It’s my job to protect you.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.160
(Krit)

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520
Who's calling you?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560
Is it about work?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400
Take it.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400
Hello, Krit.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440
How's Pat?

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960
Pat?

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.880
He's better now.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.440
I called because I wanted
to ask you something.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.160
I’m meeting a friend
I want you to meet.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080
Are you free to come?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.040
It’s fine if not. I understand

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.000
if you need to take care of Pat.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.720
Tonight?

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840
I...

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.480
Is this the appointment
you told me about?

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.920
It’s fine. You should go.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.920
Don’t worry, I’m much better now.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.040
Okay, Krit. I’ll see you soon.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.280
Okay, see you.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.440
I’m glad we're partners,
Sexy May.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.920
You’re even more beautiful
than Krit described.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.640
We’re planning to expand soon.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.360
If you’re interested,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.840
we’d be happy to welcome
someone as brilliant as you.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.960
Thank you.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.480
I’ll have to think about it.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.800
You and Krit
look like you’d make a great match.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520
Nonsense.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.440
She's my junior.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.280
Also...

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.000
She's getting married soon.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.520
Really?

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.480
What a shame for Krit.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.800
He really likes you.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.400
He talks about you all the time.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.560
Stop it, you’re talking too much.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800
Drink up.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.000
(11:50 pm)

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.720
Please excuse me.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240
Is everything okay?

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.200
Did Pat call you?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.920
He didn’t call me at all.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.000
I think he’s really trying to change
for me.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.440
Like I said,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.600
changing who you are
means forcing it.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.720
How long can he keep that up?

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.760
I feel guilty.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.800
I shouldn’t be here.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240
May.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360
Don't overthink it.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.600
You’ve done nothing wrong.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.040
Krit, I think that

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.720
we shouldn’t meet for now.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120
Why not?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.240
We’re meeting for work,
we’re partners.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.760
My friend and I discussed
expanding the business.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.960
I want you as our partner.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.080
Thank you.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.040
But I'm not ready.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960
I’ll only be a partner at this bar.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.120
Let me think about it.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.040
I’ll get going.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.040
Please apologize to
your friend for me.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.800
Okay, no problem.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.840
May.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.280
You're home.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Pat.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.840
It's late. Why are you still up?

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.680
I’m cleaning up my wound.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880
Thank you.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120
Are you okay?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960
I'm sorry.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.640
Wait. Hey.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.640
For what?

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.120
For leaving me alone at home?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.600
May, I'm used to it. It's okay.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.160
I was just cleaning up my wound.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.360
I was a bit clumsy but I made it.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440
Come here.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040
Thank you.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880
Okay?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.080
(Krit)

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.320
Hello.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.320
How are you? Are you home?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.920
I'm worried about you.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.440
Krit, this is me. Pat.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040
Hey.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.560
Did I call you by mistake?

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320
Where's May?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.040
She's in the shower.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.880
What is it?

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.160
She left her phone outside.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.960
Do you want to leave a message?

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.360
No, it's fine.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.200
I'll talk to her later.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.800
Don't tell her
I called you by mistake.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.440
- Okay.
- Thanks.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.600
Don't overthink about us.
Good night.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.360
Thank you.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.720
May.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.920
I thought you were asleep.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.080
Was it work?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680
Yes.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.480
Where were you?

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.480
I was looking
at the video from Krit's bar.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680
May.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240
What is it?

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.400
Nothing.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.280
I have to go out of town for work.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.720
There’s an old project
I need to help a client with.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.160
Sure.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.120
There’s nothing
you can do at the office right now.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400
Don't worry.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.640
But I’ll be coming home late
these days.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.960
I have to prepare for a pitch
for a new client.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.400
It’s late.
You should get some sleep.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.320
Don’t respond
to unimportant messages.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200
Okay.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.440
- Good night.
- Night.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.720
May.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.120
- Yes?
- Are you sick again?

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.040
I'm fine.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.440
I’m just dizzy
and have a runny nose. I’ll be fine.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.880
You went to bed late, that’s why
your immune system is down.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.880
Your body isn’t in the best shape
right now.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.360
If work isn’t too important today,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.200
take a sick day and rest.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.400
You said you were in a hurry.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.840
You should go, or you’ll be late.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440
Right.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.400
I’ll come back as soon as I’m done.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.240
You said you were going to spend
the night there.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.840
Why would you drive home
after a long day? It’s dangerous.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.720
Pat, take care of yourself.
Don’t worry about me too much.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.920
Okay.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.920
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.880
Get well soon.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.320
Have a safe trip.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Hello.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.600
How's the office?

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.520
Nothing to report here.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.000
I’m calling about Krit.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.840
What about him?

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.400
He’s been waiting for you
at the office for a while.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.760
He asked me where you were

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.920
because you wouldn’t
answer his calls.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.440
I’m actually a little sick.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.600
Please tell him I won’t be going in.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.000
I’ll review the work online.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440
Okay.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160
Thanks.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.680
Were you able to reach her?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.640
Yes, she’s a little sick.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.320
So she didn’t answer your call.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.800
She won’t be coming in.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.880
She’ll probably call you later.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800
What about Pat?

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.840
Pat’s out of town for work.
He’ll be back tomorrow.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560
Please excuse me.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240
Krit.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.040
Krit.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.920
Didn’t I text you saying I’m sick?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.320
That’s why
I didn’t answer your call.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880
Really?

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.000
Why do I feel like
you’re avoiding me?

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.320
Why would I avoid you?

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.840
Do you feel better now?

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080
Yes.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.880
I’ll get some more rest, and I’ll
see you at the office tomorrow.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.960
Thank you for worrying about me.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400
Wait.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800
What is it?

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800
Well...

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680
I got cheated by a friend.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.680
I didn’t think this would happen
because I trusted him.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.720
He took millions.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.440
Really?

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.600
Have you filed a police report?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880
There’s no point.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.040
I don’t have any proof.
The police wouldn’t believe me.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.920
What are you going to do then?

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.240
I’ll shut down the bar

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520
and move back overseas.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.040
But you started this bar
from scratch.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.440
Are you just going to give up?

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.560
You love this bar, don’t you?

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800
I do.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.000
I love this bar
because I've got my friend...

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.920
and I've got you.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.600
But now I have no one left.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.800
You probably don’t want
to be involved anymore.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.200
You’re going to leave me
to marry Pat.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.240
I have no one.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.680
I’ll try to sell the bar

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.760
and return your money.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.840
Don’t worry about the money.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.600
I want you to fight for your bar.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440
If I had you,

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840
I’d be ready to fight.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.840
- Krit, please don't do this.
- May.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.320
- Krit.
- I love you.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.320
- Stop, Krit.
- I’ve always loved you. May.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.400
Krit.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.960
- I love you.
- Don't.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.120
I know you love me too.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240
- May.
- Krit.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.320
Krit.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.280
You should go. Let's talk later.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640
Pat.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.000
How are you? What are you doing?

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240
I just arrived at the hotel.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.440
I’m going to shower and go to bed,
so I’m calling you first.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680
How are you?

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.200
Krit knows I’m sick,
so he dropped by.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.000
We’re talking in front of the house.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.120
Krit, it's Pat.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.600
Pat.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.480
Come home
and take care of your girlfriend.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.960
Don’t leave her alone for long.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160
Pat.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.640
After Krit leaves, I’ll go to bed.
You should too.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120
See you tomorrow.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Okay.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.640
You should go, Krit.
I’m begging you. Don’t do this.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.960
Thank you for always caring
about me.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.440
But I think
we should just stay friends.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.840
As for your bar,

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.240
if you need my help,

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.440
I’ll do what I can.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.520
Okay.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.800
Krit.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.320
Love isn’t about charity.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.000
And pity alone can’t make it last.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.880
You still haven’t come home.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.480
I can’t let you have all the fun.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.440
You’re keeping a secret from me,
aren’t you?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Tell me.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.800
Pat.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.920
Let's break up.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.520
Please, give me a chance
to make things right.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
- Cut.
- Cut.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.640
- Sorry.
- A slate for your camera.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.680
Cut.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.120
- Pat.
- What?

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.400
- Hey.
- Okay.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.480
Cut.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.920
Oh no.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600
Set.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.840
And action!

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880
May.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.000
I'm sorry. I tripped over the rug.
