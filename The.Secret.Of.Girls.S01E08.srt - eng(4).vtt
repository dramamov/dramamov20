"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 8)

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.500
Why are you here so late at night?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.380
Could it be that my snoring disturbed you?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
No.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.179
Ok, you scared me

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.619
I thought my snoring was bothering you.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.140
You are disturbing me now.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.636
You feel uncomfortable
if you don't say something to me, right?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.660
Yes.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.420
I'm always sleepless at night.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.740
My mind is in a whirl when I close my eyes.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.100
Then I found that watching the moon
can calm me down.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.700
Sounds strange.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.460
But now after you said.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.340
I found that the moon does look pretty.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.700
Well, to be honest.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.300
Before this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.540
I have never looked at
the moon so seriously.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.180
I noticed that you are similar to the moon.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.180
If you want to praise
my beauty, just say it.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.940
I mean that you are as cold as the moon.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.940
Did you see the star next to the moon?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.900
The brightest one

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.660
Venus.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.580
If you were the moon

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.060
I should be the star next to it.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.700
Just like you, a pest that follows.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.300
You're killing my vibe.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.740
Why did you give your room to them?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.020
Did you think they were worth
your pity, just like you at the start,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.180
so you helped them...?

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.500
I didn't think so much.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.860
You need a reason to hurt someone.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.916
But you don't need a reason to help someone

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.300
I helped just because I wanted to.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.820
But have you ever thought about
if I didn't let you in?

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.859
Where would you go then?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.860
I did think about it.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.820
I was thinking about it
when I was in front of your room door.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.420
And?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.180
And I realized that of course
you wouldn't, Sister Wen Shan.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.356
You are such a beautiful
and kind person, right?

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.620
You accepted me once time.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.339
Of course you will take me in for second.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.580
Don't give me that.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.459
But I made a mistake

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.460
I didn't expect you to
let me sleep on the floor.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.220
Your bed is so big,
why don't you give me half of it?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.659
And we've slept together
before, haven't we?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.060
I...

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.700
You what?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.260
I don't like physical contact.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.180
Got it.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.860
Aren't you going to ask me why?

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.220
Do you want to tell me?

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.460
No.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.100
So I won't ask.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.819
Don't you love to ask
"why" a million times?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.979
Curious about everything?

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.980
Always on and on?

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.980
Everyone has secrets.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.460
You have them.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.740
Maybe I have them too.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.100
If you want to tell me, I'll listen.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.060
If you don't...

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.660
then I won't ask more.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.820
Also.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.220
Don't always think that I'm
asking too many questions.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.539
I'm just keeping my
curiosity about the world.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.740
It's a good thing.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.900
Awesome.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.700
Thank you.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.940
What?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.340
Thank you?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.220
Did I hear that right?

00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:32.180
Sourpuss, you're capable
of saying thank you!

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.019
I didn't mean thank you...

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.140
I mean, you should thank me.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.260
Are you crazy? Thank you for what.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.099
For not sleeping on the streets.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.100
For letting you sleep on the room floor.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.100
That seems like you are right.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.300
So I really appreciate you,
my beautiful and kind sister Wen Shan.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.380
By the way

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.980
I can go to the police station tomorrow
to pick up my temporary ID card.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.380
By then I will have a phone with a SIM card.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.380
How about this,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.980
I will be generous this time.

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:04.755
Tomorrow, I'll meet you at the bar.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.859
After finishing your shift,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.419
I will treat you to a big meal.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:07.820
How about that?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.820
That's nice, right?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.420
But...

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.620
once you get your temporary ID card,

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.780
when will you head back?

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.460
Where?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.860
Back home.

00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:22.100
Or go to work.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.500
You have my backup phone.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.580
But I've never seen you call your family.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.660
I don't have a family.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.460
You really fought with your mom, huh.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.420
Yes.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.700
I never lied.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.380
And I haven't lied to you, either.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:48.860
OK

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.060
Stay here.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.380
What are you saying?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.620
Why does it sound like
you're happy about it?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.420
You don't want me to go, right?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.020
You're overthinking.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.620
You just hate to part company with me.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.979
If you'd say something
like that you'd die, right?

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.980
Yes.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.460
So stubborn.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.660
So...

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.220
How long do you plan on sitting
here and watching the moon?

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.100
Until the moon sets.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.900
Then the sun rises.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.140
Doesn't that mean I need to
sit here with you for a long time?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.300
You don't have to.

00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:35.780
No, I must do it.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.740
Hello, boss.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.500
Why are you here today?

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.900
No Long Island Iced Tea, right?

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.259
Of course no, I don't know
how I got home last time.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Thank you.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.580
Wen Shan and I carried you back.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:10.742
You carried me too?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.500
How about this,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.419
I promised Wen Shan that I would
treat her to dinner after getting off work.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.340
Come with us

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.780
I want to return the favor.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.260
No thanks. Ling Yun is home alone tonight.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.020
Okay.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.140
Hi, pretty, let me buy you a drink.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.140
No, thanks.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.379
Come on.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.980
Take it.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Get off me.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.740
Are you crazy?

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.979
I bought you a drink and wanted to
make a song request. What's with the act?

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.980
Hey.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:38.780
Excuse me.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.220
What happened?

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.660
I'm the owner.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.580
She is just our bar's singer.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.620
She doesn't drink.

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:45.019
So what that she's the bar singer?

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:46.883
I bought you a drink, show some respect!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.099
How can you earn money without my order?

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.220
What are you talking about?

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.980
I didn't do anything.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.980
But you dared to push me.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.300
Are you trying to lose your job?

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.980
How about this then?

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.339
I'll cover the bill for this table.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.220
We came here to have fun.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.140
Don't be unhappy.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.780
Right?

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.220
I'm unhappy.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.300
Look.

00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:04.580
She spilled the wine.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.459
Then she dare to hit me.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.740
You touch me first.

00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:08.372
What did you say?

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.396
Don't think that just because
you're a woman I wont hit you!

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.300
What are you doing?

00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:12.339
You're a man.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.300
Are you not ashamed to bully women?

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.540
Who are you?

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.219
If you keep going on, I'll beat you up too.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.220
You dare!

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.556
If you keep doing
this, I'll call the police.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.860
If you dare start a fight,

00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:22.885
I'll...

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.980
Xu Jingxi！

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.260
I didn't touch you!

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.300
I didn't touch you.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.659
Little girl, don't try to pull a scam.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.020
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.940
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.100
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.860
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.220
Xu Jingxi, wake up.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.020
Where are we going?

00:11:55.021 --> 00:11:56.500
Aren't we at the bar?

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.700
You just fainted.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.700
Don't you remember?

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.060
I was drunk.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.500
I can't remember.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.980
Did you pretend to faint?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.260
You found out.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.740
Am I a good actress?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.699
I was just kidding

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.100
I really fainted.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.900
Don't be worried

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.980
I've said that I would treat you to a meal.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.260
So I came with an empty stomach.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.260
I guess I was hungry.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.899
Anyway, think about it.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.580
That man was so fierce just now.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.300
I was scared.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.620
I was scared and hungry.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.740
I fainted when I got excited.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.460
If you were scared, why
didn't you hide in the back?

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.860
But he wanted to hit you.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.300
You were scared of him hitting me?

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.580
I was scared of him touching you.

00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:56.492
Can you protect yourself
when you get into trouble in the future?

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.620
I know.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.380
Let's go to the restaurant for a big meal.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.580
Okay.

00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:04.367
Mr. Driver.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.140
We're not going to the hospital.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.380
So where are we going?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.380
You decide.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.220
What do you want to eat?

00:13:12.035 --> 00:13:12.755
BBQ?

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.140
Hot pot?

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.380
Xu Jingxi?

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:18.067
Xu Jingxi?
