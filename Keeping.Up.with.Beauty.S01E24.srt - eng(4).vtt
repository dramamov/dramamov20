00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.280
The police found this in Shiqi's room.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.480
I remember seeing it
at the Fu residence as a child.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.280
I think it must be yours.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:11.000
No,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.519
it should be Yunyun's.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:17.200
Thank you.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.400
So the one who killed Yunyun

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.799
was really Gu Shiqi?

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.439
Yes.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.840
My own sister

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.319
killed the woman I loved most.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.560
Keep this jade pendant.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.920
Consider it a keepsake.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.560
Gu Yansheng...

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.599
Yunyun once

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.840
prepared a gift for you.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.159
She wanted to give it to you
when you returned home.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.159
Come here.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.280
Come on, come over here.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.759
When I come back,

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.039
I'll tell everyone about us.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.280
We'll never be apart again.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.970
What kind of flower is that?

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.360
Forget-me-not.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.240
(Two years isn't long.)

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960
(Wait for me to come back.)

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.080
(Focus on your studies.)

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.919
(I'll be waiting for you to return.)

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.020
(Yansheng, welcome back.)

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.380
(Yansheng, welcome back.)

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.439
General,

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.319
have you made up your mind?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.919
Don't go back.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.639
Great Liang is rotten to the core.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.280
You alone

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.560
can't change it.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.160
And that day I arrived,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.800
you saw it with your own eyes.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.590
Most of the Southern Wind Camp
was either dead or wounded.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.079
Great Liang

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.360
is beyond saving now.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.360
I don't want...

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.560
I don't want to see you

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.920
die before my eyes again.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.079
I started training

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.800
in martial arts at six.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.279
By fifteen,
I was already on the battlefield.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.480
I've never had a single moment
that truly belonged to me.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.639
Maybe Heaven took pity on me.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.879
Fu Yunyun gave me
a second chance to live.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.040
Whether it's the past or the present,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.639
I'll live my life to the fullest.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560
You should too.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.800
General,

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:24.790
no matter where you are,

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:25.800
I'll always be...

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.480
My friend.

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.240
My best friend.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:36.959
Alright.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.860
(Bound by life, sworn by death.)

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.000
(Thank you, Nangong Yu.)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.879
(Thank you for fulfilling my last wish.)

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.319
(The pact of
the General's Token is complete.)

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.439
And now,
what's left of my consciousness

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.199
is about to fade away.

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:23.360
From this moment,

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.519
the choice is yours.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.120
To my left lies
the time you live in now.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.360
To my right,
the world you once came from.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.199
But whichever you choose,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.240
the other will close forever.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.480
There will be no second chance.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.519
If you stay,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.560
you'll become part of this moment.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.959
The ties of your past
will slowly fade away.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.600
But if you return,

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.519
you'll awaken
on the battlefield once more.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.439
Yet everything that's happened here

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.360
will vanish like a dream.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.560
Make your choice.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.399
Time is running out.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.639
Alright.

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.759
(I can't change your past anymore.)

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.360
(But from this moment on,
everything you do,)

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.319
(every decision you make,)

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.199
(I'll face it with you.)

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.079
(I want to fight for us one more time.)

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.639
(Let's start over.)

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.120
(Give me another chance.)

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.279
(Please?)

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:09.399
- Attack!
- Attack!

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.320
(I hope that)

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.720
(when I open my eyes again,)

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:43.080
the first person I see

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.279
is you.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.080
Okay.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.600
I'll think about it.
