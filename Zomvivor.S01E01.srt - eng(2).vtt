Come on! Hurry!

Quickly! Quickly!

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:17.345
Hurry!

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.265
Hurry!

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:19.265
Everyone, move!

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:20.185
Go, go, go!

Jane. Jane.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:28.025
Jane.

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:29.425
Please go.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:31.545
No. I'm not leaving, Jane.

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.225
Get away. Hurry.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.385
No, I'm taking you to the hospital.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.705
Don't.

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:43.065
Jane! Jane!

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.145
Stay with me, Jane.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.105
Why? Don't make me say it.

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:48.345
Stay with me.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.905
How?

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.225
Jane.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:54.225
It's okay, Jane.

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:55.145
Jane! Jane!

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:56.625
Easy, Jane.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:58.065
You're going to make it.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.065
-Jane!
-Let's just break up then.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.825
Feeling better now, Jane?

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:27.025
Jane.

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:31.945
Jane.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:32.865

Go. Quickly.

Go! Now!

Stop!

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:11.505
Don't come any closer.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:34.425
That's enough, Thorn.
We have to leave now!

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:38.065
San, come on.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:39.105
San, go!

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.385
-San.
-Run, Thorn!

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:41.425
Come on. Move it.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:55.825

Hey!

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:12.825
Get in this room!

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:14.425
Go, go!

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:15.345
Get in!

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:17.025
-Move it!
-Lock the doors.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:22.785
This way.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:46.585
That doesn't look good.

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:47.665

NING

00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:07.745
Hello, Ning. Where are you?

00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:09.465
Stuck in the faculty building.

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:11.225
What about Non? Is he with you?

00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:12.625
I can't reach him.

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.305
Are you outside, Professor?

00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:17.065
Please help my mom.

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:19.265
Sure. I'll take care of her.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:22.105
Find a place to hide and contact Non.
Understood?

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:28.305
Ning!

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:30.225
Can you hear me?

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:36.985
Ning?

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:38.865
I'll call you back.

00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:39.785
Ning!

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:41.585
Ning.

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:55.505
The Prime Minister is set to announce
a state of emergency in Bangkok,

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:59.145
following reports that the outbreak

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.665
may have originated
at Kiatpipat University.

00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:17.185
Kawin.

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:20.105
This isn't a safe place to hide.
They'll eventually find us.

00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:24.305
To the balcony.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:32.705
Guys, this way! Come on!

00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:39.345
-Hurry.
-I can't.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:40.865
No, I'm too scared!

00:06:40.945 --> 00:06:42.145
Want to get eaten?

00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:43.345
Get moving already!

00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:50.585
Quickly.

00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:04.105
Hey!

00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:05.345
Over there!

00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:09.305
Is that Ning?

00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:16.425
Non.

00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:19.025
Where are you, Non?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.425
Right across from you.
Just look straight ahead.

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:23.185
This way!

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:25.025
Hey! Non!

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:26.705
Guys!

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:37.185
-Hey!
-Shit!

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.345
In light of the current situation,

00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:43.945
we urge everyone to remain calm

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:47.225
and continue monitoring
the situation closely.

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:37.505
What's the plan?

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:39.585
We can't stay here forever.

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:40.664
Can I?

00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:43.305
Ning.

00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:44.425
Are you okay?

00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:45.465
Just a second.

00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:46.385
What, Phu?

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:49.265
Tell them to meet us at the library.
Let me talk to them.

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:51.945
Hello.

00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:54.065
Can you hear me? Listen closely.

00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:57.225
Find your way to the library.

00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:01.265
It's under maintenance,
so nobody should be there.

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:03.025
Let's meet there.

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:05.425
Are you insane? How do we get there?

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:07.225
Shit. Shush. They're coming.

00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:08.345
I have no clue.

00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:10.785
Just don't die.

00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:19.345
Help me!

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:21.785
Somebody help me!

00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:33.665
We need to find a way to the library…

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:36.585
or else we will not make it.

00:11:44.025 --> 00:11:45.025
Cut!

00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:48.265
Are we good now?

00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:51.505
That was fantastic.

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:55.705
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:57.185
Thi,

00:11:57.265 --> 00:11:58.345
what do you think?

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.265
-Lily.
-Yes?

00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:15.825
Would it look weird if tears
were rolling down in the final shot?

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.825
Yes, it would look very weird.

00:12:20.905 --> 00:12:23.025
My character is a zombie.
She shouldn't cry.

00:12:24.185 --> 00:12:25.345
Well…

00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:26.745
It sounds interesting.

00:12:28.065 --> 00:12:28.945
Stop.

00:12:29.025 --> 00:12:30.745
Stop saying it's interesting.

00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:32.065
What does it mean?

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:34.545
Aren't you the director?

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.345
Stop throwing out random ideas.

00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:39.065
You need to know what you want.

00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:40.465
I understand.

00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.665
It's not that I can't deliver,

00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:45.065
but I don't think
this character should cry.

00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:46.905
It's not that. It's…

00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:48.985
Why do directors always want tears?

00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:50.465
Well, it's…

00:12:50.545 --> 00:12:52.825
Crying doesn't make
a scene better, does it?

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:55.865
No, I mean,
you're about to transform, right?

00:12:56.545 --> 00:13:00.745
However, you're stuck
between being a human and a zombie.

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:03.025
I want the audience to question

00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:07.585
whether the tears are coming
from Virginia as a human or as a zombie.

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:13.025
Firstly, Thi,
you should rename my character.

00:13:13.105 --> 00:13:14.065
Virginia?

00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:16.505
-It sounds ridiculous.
-No, it doesn't.

00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:18.265
That's the core of this film.

00:13:18.345 --> 00:13:20.985
Patriarchy, is it?

00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:22.905
It's too obvious, Thi.

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:24.705
Didn't Naruemon teach you,

00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:26.745
"Show, don't tell"?

00:13:26.825 --> 00:13:28.825
Excuse me. We're running out of light.

00:13:31.025 --> 00:13:33.825
Yeah, Thi. I think this works.

00:13:33.905 --> 00:13:36.825
This short film is just an assignment.
Do it and submit it.

00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:43.305
Fine. Okay.

00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:45.585
Go stand behind the monitor.

00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:47.225
Where?

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:49.385
Behind the monitor. Come here, Non.

00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:51.865
Chop-chop. Hurry, we're losing light.

00:13:51.945 --> 00:13:52.945
Let's go.

00:14:25.825 --> 00:14:26.905
Nice.

00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:30.545
It really does look weird.

00:14:34.225 --> 00:14:35.105
Right?

00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:36.625
Told you.

00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:38.065
Yeah.

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:38.985
Scratch that.

00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:40.345
That's a wrap!

00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:42.305
Yay!

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:43.225
Good job.

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:44.905
Let's have dinner.

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.105
What's up with him?

00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:53.385
ZAN: PICKING UP NING TODAY.

00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:59.665
The heat wave expected
to encompass Southeast Asia

00:14:59.745 --> 00:15:02.665
in the coming months
may cause erratic weather patterns,

00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:05.385
severely affecting
residents in the region.

00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:07.625
Shit. This is fucking scary.

00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:08.865
What is it?

00:15:08.945 --> 00:15:11.305
The heat wave. Haven't you seen the news?

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:13.185
So what?

00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:14.985
What? This can be fatal!

00:15:15.065 --> 00:15:17.145
People dropped like flies in Spain.

00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:20.545
People die every day.
It's got nothing to do with that.

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:25.505
Should I fly to the U.S.
and stay there for a few months?

00:15:26.145 --> 00:15:27.065
It's your call.

00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:28.025
Join me, then.

00:15:29.825 --> 00:15:30.745
I'd rather not.

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:32.825
Hey, come with me.

00:15:33.585 --> 00:15:35.905
You can take Ning, too. Stay at my place.

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:36.905
Motherfucker.

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:39.505
Her mom is bedridden, unresponsive.

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:42.345
You're right.

00:15:43.905 --> 00:15:45.185
Have Non look after her.

00:15:47.305 --> 00:15:50.625
Listen. Your brother should stop
acting like a bigshot director.

00:15:50.705 --> 00:15:51.945
It's a film assignment.

00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:54.705
But he's treating it
like it's an award-winning project.

00:15:54.785 --> 00:15:56.625
Yeah, he's fucking insane.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:58.585
If Thi stays this ambitious,

00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:00.825
Non won't be able to take care of his mom.

00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:03.425
I can't really reason with him either.

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:06.585
That's because you're dumber than he is.

00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:08.145
Am I wrong?

00:16:09.425 --> 00:16:11.145
If you think you're smarter…

00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:13.625
why are you in a freshman class?

00:16:15.065 --> 00:16:16.065
What the fuck?

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:18.785
Catch you later.

00:16:19.225 --> 00:16:20.545
I'm driving Ning home.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:23.505
Right. See you.

00:16:24.905 --> 00:16:27.785
You don't know about the heat wave,
and you call me dumb.

00:16:27.865 --> 00:16:28.865
Dumbass.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:33.145
You've only got a year left.
Are you really giving up the scholarship?

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:34.185
Yes.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.225
I've thought this through.

00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:40.585
With my mom in this condition,
I can't focus on anything.

00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:43.745
I understand.

00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:47.185
I'll withdraw after this semester.

00:16:47.825 --> 00:16:49.985
Ning, wait. Hold that thought.

00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:55.865
What's the matter?

00:16:56.785 --> 00:16:59.305
I've sent your mother's
lab results to the higher-up.

00:17:01.505 --> 00:17:03.705
The higher-up? Who?

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:05.585
The Patron.

00:17:06.585 --> 00:17:07.585
The Patron?

00:17:10.105 --> 00:17:12.065
His son has the same illness.

00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:14.385
Joe?

00:17:14.944 --> 00:17:16.305
I still saw him on TV.

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:17.665
Don't tell anybody.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.265
This is top secret.

00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:22.665
We'd be screwed if this got leaked.

00:17:23.145 --> 00:17:24.825
Why are you telling me this?

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:32.025
The Patron funded
the research for the cure.

00:17:33.465 --> 00:17:34.985
Everything must stay a secret.

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:36.745
Do you follow?

00:17:37.305 --> 00:17:39.065
We just went through COVID.

00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:41.505
No one wants to face another outbreak now.

00:17:41.585 --> 00:17:42.425
And?

00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:51.065
I'll propose including
your mother in the research.

00:17:52.985 --> 00:17:56.345
So you don't need to withdraw,
and she'll be treated with extreme care.

00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:57.905
And be a lab rat in exchange?

00:18:00.505 --> 00:18:04.265
She might have to go through that
if the head of the research wasn't me

00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:06.785
and if the assistant wasn't you, Ning.

00:18:10.185 --> 00:18:11.425
Can you elaborate?

00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:16.585
You're the finest student of the batch,
and you know that.

00:18:17.025 --> 00:18:19.425
You're better than some of the professors.

00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:21.905
Even without this illness…

00:18:23.025 --> 00:18:25.545
I'd still pitch this project to you.

00:18:26.665 --> 00:18:27.825
Who's in the research?

00:18:27.905 --> 00:18:29.465
It's just the two of us.

00:18:29.545 --> 00:18:32.185
If you need anything, just ask.

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.225
The higher-up will handle it.

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:38.865
What's your call, Ning?

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:43.345
Will you stay
and help me save your mother?

00:18:46.745 --> 00:18:48.825
Just say yes. It's a no-brainer.

00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:50.305
Hold up.

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.585
What if the research fails?

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:54.145
How will Ning endure the pain?

00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:55.425
Pain?

00:18:56.025 --> 00:18:57.105
What pain?

00:18:57.905 --> 00:18:58.785
Well…

00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:01.585
The pain of knowing
I killed my own mother.

00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:06.145
And you're just going to wait

00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:08.945
for Professor Wiroj
to give your mother the medicine?

00:19:09.025 --> 00:19:10.225
You wouldn't do that.

00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:11.705
Keep it down, Jean.

00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:22.105
In the end, if you walk away now,

00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:23.745
won't you regret it later?

00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:30.545
How many people have the opportunity
to invent a cure for their own mother?

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:31.985
You and your macho thoughts.

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.905
It's coming from someone
who's never had parents.

00:19:39.385 --> 00:19:42.785
Besides, you don't have to
give up your future.

00:19:43.305 --> 00:19:46.545
The Patron will care for your mom.
What are you afraid of?

00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:48.745
I'm scared…

00:19:51.705 --> 00:19:53.665
that I won't be good enough.

00:19:57.425 --> 00:19:58.425
Ning…

00:19:59.185 --> 00:20:01.945
I know you can't take a compliment,

00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:04.105
but don't think about that for a second.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:08.825
Just focus on doing
whatever it takes to cure your mom.

00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.545
Can you focus on that?

00:20:16.785 --> 00:20:17.705
Yeah.

00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:20.185
Moreover…

00:20:21.265 --> 00:20:22.705
you must not forget that…

00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:24.545
you're…

00:20:25.185 --> 00:20:26.785
someone who is…

00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:28.065
gorgeous.

00:20:32.225 --> 00:20:35.265
-That's only natural, isn't it?
-Not as much as me, though.

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:37.745
I'm the Faculty Queen.

00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:40.505
That doesn't count.
My face wasn't fully healed.

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:41.825
Is it healed now, though?

00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:43.585
Do I look flawless now?

00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:44.905
-Gosh!
-I don't think so.

00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:46.665
What's with you guys?

00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:48.585
You stressed me out again.

00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:01.625
I owe you guys, you know?

00:21:04.385 --> 00:21:06.185
I'll think about the offer.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.665
I feel better now.

00:21:19.825 --> 00:21:20.905
I have to go now.

00:21:20.985 --> 00:21:21.985
See you.

00:21:44.545 --> 00:21:45.545
Huh?

00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:47.065
What?

00:22:06.185 --> 00:22:07.385
Why aren't we going?

00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:10.265
What were you saying?

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.185
What?

00:22:14.865 --> 00:22:17.465
What's with holding hands with those two?

00:22:19.065 --> 00:22:21.025
We just held hands. It's nothing serious.

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:24.505
Really?

00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:26.585
I don't like it.

00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.985
Ning, I don't like it.

00:22:32.065 --> 00:22:33.745
Can we not argue about this?

00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:35.945
I'm exhausted.

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:45.945
I've paid Non's tuition.

00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:52.105
Thank you.

00:22:52.825 --> 00:22:55.305
I'll repay you
once I get paid for the research.

00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:57.185
Sure thing.

00:22:57.865 --> 00:22:59.185
There's no rush.

00:22:59.985 --> 00:23:01.865
I know that you need the money.

00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:05.985
No. I don't want to prolong the debt.

00:23:06.065 --> 00:23:08.425
Let's get going. I want to see my mother.

00:23:14.985 --> 00:23:16.625
I love sorting the trash.

00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:19.945
Oh, handsome!

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:21.305
Perfect timing.

00:23:21.385 --> 00:23:22.465
Hi, auntie.

00:23:22.545 --> 00:23:23.465
Good to see you.

00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:25.705
How are things? Feeling better now?

00:23:25.785 --> 00:23:27.305
I'm doing a lot better.

00:23:28.025 --> 00:23:30.185
Trash doesn't stink once it's sorted.

00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:31.425
It's different now.

00:23:31.505 --> 00:23:34.545
When all sorts of junk
were dumped into one bin,

00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:35.465
it was too much.

00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:36.545
Yeah.

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:39.465
I think the problem
is the liquid and the ice.

00:23:39.545 --> 00:23:41.865
If there were food-waste bins,
it'd be simpler.

00:23:41.945 --> 00:23:45.625
Fortunately, for your floor,
Professor Wiroj had it sorted out for us.

00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:47.585
For other floors, it's unbearable.

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:50.425
The staff refuses to separate the bins.

00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:52.065
Why is that, auntie?

00:23:52.145 --> 00:23:54.065
They say bins would make it worse

00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:56.825
and make students
bring more food upstairs.

00:23:57.945 --> 00:23:58.945
What the heck?

00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:00.945
If I complain too much,

00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:03.345
they'll hire dedicated janitors for sure.

00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:04.425
Mom.

00:24:07.025 --> 00:24:09.345
Just stay there. Don't come any closer.

00:24:12.145 --> 00:24:13.065
I'll be back, dear.

00:24:13.145 --> 00:24:14.145
Right.

00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:23.985
He comes here a lot lately.

00:24:25.065 --> 00:24:26.505
It seems like something's up.

00:24:29.225 --> 00:24:30.865
Has she shared anything with you?

00:24:30.945 --> 00:24:31.825
Of course.

00:24:34.905 --> 00:24:37.145
I've heard that
he owes money to a boxing gym,

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:38.105
like six figures.

00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:39.545
Six figures?

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:40.985
Her bank account got seized.

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:42.625
Her bank account?

00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:45.105
Why did they do that?

00:24:46.265 --> 00:24:48.505
When she gets paid here,

00:24:48.585 --> 00:24:50.265
it goes straight into her account.

00:24:51.025 --> 00:24:52.305
When it's her payday,

00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:54.465
her creditor withdraws her salary.

00:24:57.465 --> 00:25:00.265
And how is she able to pay
for her expenses?

00:25:01.185 --> 00:25:02.665
She also cleans other places,

00:25:03.385 --> 00:25:04.625
like houses…

00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:06.465
and condos.

00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:08.465
I don't know, man.

00:25:18.025 --> 00:25:18.945
Pao.

00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:21.385
Yeah?

00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:26.945
You didn't give
your money to Auntie Jit, did?

00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:37.345
You haven't paid
for photocopies in months.

00:25:38.265 --> 00:25:39.625
Ning asked me to remind you.

00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:41.385
Don't worry. I'll pay soon.

00:25:43.305 --> 00:25:44.745
I've taken care of that.

00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:51.865
Your allowance…

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:55.465
You have to manage it well.

00:25:56.665 --> 00:25:58.505
If you really want to help her…

00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:02.705
there are other ways to do it.

00:26:05.145 --> 00:26:05.985
Mmm.

00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:07.985
Don't just say "Mmm", do it.

00:26:11.385 --> 00:26:13.065
What the fuck are you looking at?

00:26:13.145 --> 00:26:14.265
Want a piece of me?

00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:15.505
Right, right. Please go.

00:26:15.585 --> 00:26:16.465
Jean.

00:26:17.945 --> 00:26:19.225
Right, I know.

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:25.065
Tell me about the bags.

00:26:25.145 --> 00:26:26.665
This one is for glass bottles.

00:26:26.745 --> 00:26:28.465
FIRST PLACE, SCIENCE OLYMPIAD

00:26:36.785 --> 00:26:39.465
Thank you, Auntie Na,
for looking after my mother.

00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:42.185
-I might need your help again next week.
-No problem.

00:26:42.265 --> 00:26:43.545
Thank you.

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.505
Make yourself at home, babe.

00:26:54.105 --> 00:26:56.105
I need to help my mom
get cleaned up first.

00:26:56.185 --> 00:26:58.265
Let's eat when Non gets back.

00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:03.665
Hold on, Ning. Can I ask you something?

00:27:03.745 --> 00:27:05.705
When did your mom first show symptoms?

00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:08.745
I mean…

00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:10.785
before she went into a coma.

00:27:11.585 --> 00:27:13.465
About six months ago.

00:27:13.825 --> 00:27:14.745
Why did you ask?

00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:17.025
I just talked to my family.

00:27:19.505 --> 00:27:21.105
They're ready to help you.

00:27:21.785 --> 00:27:23.865
Let experienced doctors take care of her.

00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:27.985
It's okay. I've talked to a higher-up.

00:27:28.425 --> 00:27:29.705
Which higher-up?

00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:32.065
The owner of the college.

00:27:33.225 --> 00:27:35.585
When? Why didn't you tell me?

00:27:36.065 --> 00:27:37.465
You spoke to him directly?

00:27:39.385 --> 00:27:41.665
No, Professor Wiroj spoke to him for me.

00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:44.545
And why do you look so surprised?

00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:48.585
Nothing.

00:27:48.665 --> 00:27:49.705
That's great.

00:27:50.185 --> 00:27:51.225
That's all.

00:27:52.625 --> 00:27:53.465
Mmm.

00:27:53.945 --> 00:27:55.225
I'm off.

00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:56.145
Mmm.

00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:37.905
San!

00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:49.945
Where's Ning?

00:28:51.025 --> 00:28:52.345
She's cleaning Mom up.

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:54.505
Mmm.

00:28:56.825 --> 00:28:57.985
Finished filming?

00:28:58.065 --> 00:28:59.305
Yes.

00:28:59.385 --> 00:29:00.305
Did it go well?

00:29:05.105 --> 00:29:06.025
I guess.

00:29:07.065 --> 00:29:07.905
Good.

00:29:08.785 --> 00:29:11.265
And the camera I gave you? Is it good?

00:29:12.225 --> 00:29:13.065
Mmm.

00:29:13.905 --> 00:29:14.785
Oh.

00:29:15.745 --> 00:29:16.825
You're home.

00:29:17.265 --> 00:29:18.785
You said you'd be home late.

00:29:19.505 --> 00:29:21.505
San wants to have dinner with us.

00:29:22.265 --> 00:29:25.385
After I'm done cleaning Mom up,
let's go out for dinner.

00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:26.385
Okay.

00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:34.745
Hey. Were you in the middle
of a conversation?

00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:37.785
No.

00:29:58.865 --> 00:30:00.025
It's done, sir.

00:30:01.185 --> 00:30:02.985
But we need to give her time…

00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:06.945
so that she feels like the one
making the decision.

00:30:11.745 --> 00:30:17.265
PRESENT TIME

00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:32.905
They're everywhere.
How can we leave this place?

00:30:33.905 --> 00:30:35.785
Hello, Dad. Where are you?

00:30:35.865 --> 00:30:37.345
Fah, what are you doing?

00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:38.265
Hey.

00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:39.425
-Quiet!
-Put it away!

00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:40.425
Calm down.

00:30:44.745 --> 00:30:46.105
Guys…

00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:47.545
I think…

00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:49.185
we have to lure them away.

00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:54.225
How about breaking a window?

00:30:54.305 --> 00:30:56.945
Thorn. No, it's too risky.

00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:03.585
What the fuck are they doing here?
Don't they have other places to go?

00:31:03.665 --> 00:31:06.105
Looks like they have nowhere else to go.

00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:07.785
Maybe no food left.

00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:12.225
There's this fucker left.
She's gonna get us all eaten alive.

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:15.985
Prao, stop insulting her.
Do you think it helps?

00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:21.705
We have to lure them all away
so we can move, right?

00:31:22.425 --> 00:31:23.265
Yeah.

00:31:23.345 --> 00:31:24.345
Of course.

00:31:26.345 --> 00:31:28.505
Place this speaker in the building.

00:31:28.585 --> 00:31:30.305
Then play the audio to attract them.

00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:32.345
Yeah, let's do that.

00:31:34.305 --> 00:31:35.345
Good idea.

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:38.545
This speaker has great range.

00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.825
We can set it up
deeper inside the building.

00:31:40.905 --> 00:31:42.305
It will also buy us time.

00:31:42.385 --> 00:31:44.345
If we crank the volume to the max,

00:31:44.425 --> 00:31:47.025
they'll probably rush in there
all at once.

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.825
Once the path is clear…

00:31:50.465 --> 00:31:52.465
we have to sprint our way across, okay?

00:31:52.545 --> 00:31:55.065
We need to make a run for it.
Don't look back.

00:31:55.825 --> 00:31:57.105
It's such a long way, Thi.

00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:58.825
We have no choice.

00:31:59.305 --> 00:32:00.625
Stop being dramatic.

00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.905
Who is going to place the speaker?

00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:37.065
Guys, listen.

00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:40.185
We are going to split into three groups.

00:32:40.985 --> 00:32:41.985
Phu…

00:32:42.825 --> 00:32:44.025
you're going with Mook.

00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:46.305
I…

00:32:47.625 --> 00:32:48.705
will go with Ning.

00:32:50.105 --> 00:32:51.905
Pao and Night, you're going with Nan.

00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.225
Okay?

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:56.825
Nan, you can still walk, right?

00:32:57.425 --> 00:32:58.745
I'll do my best, Phu.

00:32:59.465 --> 00:33:00.505
I have no choice now.

00:33:02.905 --> 00:33:06.345
-Go. Just go.
-You're the oldest here, so you go.

00:33:08.865 --> 00:33:09.745
I'll go.

00:33:14.825 --> 00:33:16.105
Are you up for this?

00:33:17.145 --> 00:33:18.425
Why wouldn't I be?

00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:21.225
-I'll come with you.
-No need.

00:33:21.305 --> 00:33:22.985
-I know the spot.
-Hold up.

00:33:23.065 --> 00:33:24.025
Hey, Prao!

00:33:24.105 --> 00:33:24.945
Move.

00:33:25.025 --> 00:33:26.065
Why bother?

00:33:57.225 --> 00:34:00.785
Guys, the news says
it's spreading everywhere.

00:34:00.865 --> 00:34:02.745
Even the military can't control it.

00:34:02.825 --> 00:34:06.505
Power, water, and communications
in the red zone have been cut off.

00:34:06.985 --> 00:34:08.585
Why the fuck are they doing that?

00:34:09.545 --> 00:34:12.344
-It was for security purposes.
-Security purposes, my ass.

00:34:12.744 --> 00:34:13.744
This is weird.

00:34:15.105 --> 00:34:17.945
They seem to be swarming
around the lit areas.

00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:19.625
Wouldn't you agree?

00:34:21.185 --> 00:34:23.744
Take a look at the park. There are none.

00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:25.945
Yeah.

00:34:27.105 --> 00:34:29.784
-He's right.
-Guys, we have to move.

00:34:30.865 --> 00:34:32.145
Wait for my signal.

00:35:25.465 --> 00:35:27.065
Shit, the speaker's ready.

00:35:42.745 --> 00:35:44.185
I'm going to bring her back.

00:35:44.265 --> 00:35:45.705
Hey, where are you going?

00:35:45.785 --> 00:35:47.145
-Picking her up.
-Thorn!

00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:49.425
-And if you're not back?
-It won't be long.

00:36:03.825 --> 00:36:04.905
Watch your step.

00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:16.425
Hurry. Just a little further.

00:36:27.505 --> 00:36:28.545
Hey.

00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:36.345
Stop!

00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:37.825
Hey, stop!

00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:41.505
Ow.

00:36:59.265 --> 00:37:00.625
Fucking, damn it.

00:37:03.625 --> 00:37:05.145
Thorn, come here, you bastard.

00:37:05.225 --> 00:37:06.225
Go!

00:37:10.985 --> 00:37:12.185
Vin, do it.

00:37:12.265 --> 00:37:13.505
-Play the audio.
-Okay.

00:37:13.585 --> 00:37:14.985
-Ready?
-Yeah.

00:37:18.145 --> 00:37:19.505
Salmon Podcast,

00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:21.785
enjoyable, fresh, and delectable.

00:37:24.505 --> 00:37:26.425
Conspiracies, mysteries,

00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:27.865
monsters, murders,

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:29.265
-Seriously?
-oddities,

00:37:29.345 --> 00:37:32.145
-and cases scarier than fiction.
-Anything will do.

00:37:32.225 --> 00:37:33.665
Welcome, I'm Yod Banpapong.

00:37:33.745 --> 00:37:34.745
Whoa!

00:37:35.745 --> 00:37:36.945
Untitled case.

00:37:54.385 --> 00:37:55.905
Where are they going?

00:37:55.985 --> 00:37:57.105
They spotted something.

00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:58.905
They go to the Com Arts building.

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:01.265
Non's group must be the ones behind this.

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:02.865
This is our chance.

00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:05.785
Quickly!

00:38:07.305 --> 00:38:08.305
Go, go, go.

00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:10.025
Hurry!

00:38:11.945 --> 00:38:13.305
Today, we're talking about…

00:38:13.385 --> 00:38:14.585
The path's clear!

00:38:14.665 --> 00:38:15.705
Move!

00:38:15.785 --> 00:38:18.185
-I took photos of the mic.
-How much? Five figures?

00:38:18.265 --> 00:38:19.465
That's correct.

00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:21.665
I'm glad and encourage more podcasts.

00:38:21.745 --> 00:38:22.825
I want to host one.

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:24.585
However, for today's setup…

00:38:24.665 --> 00:38:26.345
Oh, our audience can't see it.

00:38:26.425 --> 00:38:27.905
-They can't.
-They can't, right?

00:38:27.985 --> 00:38:29.985
I've taken photos. Feel free to use them.

00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:33.305
We're sitting far apart,
facing each other.

00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:35.945
It's like we're in an interrogation room.

00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:37.945
Hey.

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:39.545
I don't think I can go further.

00:38:40.425 --> 00:38:41.425
Hop on my back.

00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:43.105
Come on!

00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:45.985
Pao…

00:38:46.065 --> 00:38:46.945
Huh?

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.025
Why is there blood on your back?

00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:50.345
Are you bleeding?

00:38:50.425 --> 00:38:52.225
Huh? No, I'm not.

00:39:10.465 --> 00:39:11.385
Pao!

00:39:11.465 --> 00:39:12.305
Hop on! Hurry!

00:39:12.385 --> 00:39:13.505
Come on! Hop on!

00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:14.585
Quick!

00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:26.425
Pao, hurry!

00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:27.545
Come on!

00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:29.145
They're coming!

00:39:29.225 --> 00:39:30.425
-Night!
-They're coming!

00:39:31.625 --> 00:39:32.625
They're coming!

00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:34.425
Pao! Nan!

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.345
This way!

00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:36.265
UNDER MAINTENANCE

00:39:37.025 --> 00:39:38.145
Just run!

00:39:39.825 --> 00:39:41.025
Nan!

00:39:41.105 --> 00:39:42.465
Run! Go!

00:39:46.705 --> 00:39:47.665
Pao!

00:39:59.745 --> 00:40:00.825
Pao…

00:40:03.945 --> 00:40:04.785
Come on!

00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:05.785
Nan, come here!

00:40:06.345 --> 00:40:07.345
Hurry.

00:40:08.065 --> 00:40:09.865
No, don't do it!

00:40:09.945 --> 00:40:10.985
Don't!

00:40:11.065 --> 00:40:14.465
No!

00:40:15.785 --> 00:40:16.905
Fuck!

00:40:42.305 --> 00:40:44.025
-Pao!
-Pao, stop!

00:40:44.105 --> 00:40:45.425
Pao, stop it!

00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:46.865
We need to go! Hurry!

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:47.945
Hurry! Go!

00:40:48.465 --> 00:40:49.865
We need to leave!

00:40:49.945 --> 00:40:50.825
Hurry!

00:40:50.905 --> 00:40:51.905
-Move!
-Sorry.

00:40:51.985 --> 00:40:52.945
-Run!
-They're here!

00:40:53.025 --> 00:40:53.945
I'm so sorry!

00:40:54.025 --> 00:40:54.905
Quick!

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:56.705
I'm sorry!

00:40:56.785 --> 00:40:57.705
Run!

00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:04.985
Oh, fuck!

00:41:05.305 --> 00:41:06.145
Shit…

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:07.385
Run! Keep going!

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:08.345
Hurry! Don't stop!

00:41:08.425 --> 00:41:09.345
Go!

00:41:18.905 --> 00:41:19.785
Pao.

00:41:19.865 --> 00:41:20.865
Pao.

00:41:30.025 --> 00:41:31.025
Ning!

00:41:32.025 --> 00:41:32.945
Non.

00:41:35.585 --> 00:41:37.465
Pao, don't cry.

00:41:40.145 --> 00:41:42.465
It should've been me.

00:41:42.545 --> 00:41:43.665
It's okay, Pao.

00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:30.865
Hey.

00:43:31.785 --> 00:43:33.585
Did you talk to me this evening?

00:43:35.785 --> 00:43:38.385
How can you be so sure
that none of them are here?

00:43:38.905 --> 00:43:41.265
If they were here, they would've come out.

00:43:41.345 --> 00:43:43.625
Hey, he was asking nicely.

00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:51.025
This hall only has one way in.

00:43:51.945 --> 00:43:53.585
There's a staircase at the back…

00:43:54.505 --> 00:43:55.865
for going upstairs.

00:43:56.665 --> 00:43:58.385
If something happens…

00:43:59.545 --> 00:44:02.505
we run to the meeting room,
then to the balcony.

00:44:03.305 --> 00:44:04.505
Trust us.

00:44:05.345 --> 00:44:06.785
We've thought this through.

00:44:07.265 --> 00:44:08.745
This is the safest place.

00:44:18.785 --> 00:44:20.945
Guys, check your phone.

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.945
There's no phone signal here.

00:44:26.745 --> 00:44:27.985
What about yours, Non?

00:44:30.745 --> 00:44:32.545
The service might've been shut off.

00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:33.545
By who?

00:44:34.425 --> 00:44:35.345
The government.

00:44:35.945 --> 00:44:37.585
They're claiming it was terrorism.

00:44:38.505 --> 00:44:39.425
Huh?

00:44:42.105 --> 00:44:45.865
The latest report says power and water
will be cut off, but we don't know when.

00:44:46.265 --> 00:44:48.865
They said that this could be bioterrorism.

00:44:49.225 --> 00:44:51.345
How will we contact people outside?

00:44:55.465 --> 00:44:56.465
Just pray.

00:45:05.025 --> 00:45:07.025
We have to find a way out of here.

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:08.065
To where?

00:45:08.865 --> 00:45:11.425
Haven't you seen what it's like outside?
It's a mess.

00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:12.785
We'll be dead if we leave.

00:45:13.385 --> 00:45:14.865
At least we know routes here.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:17.665
How long can we last
with the power and water gone.

00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:19.585
There are other people.

00:45:19.665 --> 00:45:20.665
Who?

00:45:21.225 --> 00:45:22.465
Survivors.

00:45:23.065 --> 00:45:24.065
So what?

00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:28.625
We need to gather people
and risk everything on one call for help.

00:45:28.705 --> 00:45:30.545
The line of communication is dead.

00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:32.305
How are we going to ask for help?

00:45:37.425 --> 00:45:39.505
A warning to the medical personnel…

00:45:42.705 --> 00:45:43.665
The wounded…

00:45:45.185 --> 00:45:47.745
…since they
might be carrying the infection.

00:45:47.825 --> 00:45:49.185
I stumbled upon this.

00:45:49.265 --> 00:45:50.865
It likely belongs to a worker.

00:45:51.825 --> 00:45:52.745
Number three.

00:45:52.825 --> 00:45:54.665
To contain the spread of the infection

00:45:54.745 --> 00:45:56.865
and prevent major damage

00:45:56.945 --> 00:45:59.665
to the city's infrastructure,

00:45:59.745 --> 00:46:02.625
CAOUV will shut off power and water

00:46:02.705 --> 00:46:04.145
in the red zone,

00:46:04.225 --> 00:46:06.065
with Ground Zero

00:46:06.145 --> 00:46:08.785
at Kiatpipat University of Innovation,

00:46:08.865 --> 00:46:09.945
located in Khlong Kum.

00:46:10.025 --> 00:46:11.745
The order will take immediate effect

00:46:11.825 --> 00:46:15.665
at 8:30 p.m. tonight.

00:46:15.745 --> 00:46:17.745
-Ground Zero?
-The public is prohibited

00:46:17.825 --> 00:46:19.225
-from entering…
-Quiet.

00:46:19.305 --> 00:46:20.465
without permission.

00:46:20.545 --> 00:46:22.865
Violators will face criminal penalties

00:46:22.945 --> 00:46:25.105
and will be subject to arrest

00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:28.305
and forceful interception by authorities.

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:29.385
Number five.

00:46:29.465 --> 00:46:31.985
Residents in the red zone

00:46:32.065 --> 00:46:34.145
are urged to seek higher ground

00:46:34.225 --> 00:46:36.665
or move to the rooftop of any building

00:46:36.745 --> 00:46:37.825
or structure.

00:46:37.905 --> 00:46:40.865
Military helicopters
will conduct daily patrols

00:46:40.945 --> 00:46:43.105
to search for and rescue survivors,

00:46:43.185 --> 00:46:45.825
starting from 8:00 a.m.

00:46:45.905 --> 00:46:47.625
-Issued on…
-We're safe now, Fah.

00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:51.625
May 15, 2024.

00:46:53.065 --> 00:46:55.665
They say our university is Ground Zero.

00:46:55.745 --> 00:46:57.025
What does that mean?

00:46:57.105 --> 00:46:59.025
And nobody's questioning that?

00:46:59.825 --> 00:47:01.985
That's not important anymore, Kawin.

00:47:03.305 --> 00:47:04.305
Okay.

00:47:06.185 --> 00:47:08.345
We'll go to the parking garage rooftop.

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:10.585
That's big enough
for a helicopter to land.

00:47:10.665 --> 00:47:11.865
We're going there now?

00:47:12.745 --> 00:47:13.745
Wait, let's not.

00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:17.465
We need to let everyone know.

00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:20.785
The PR room is upstairs.
Who's coming with me? We're out of time.

00:47:20.865 --> 00:47:21.705
Wait.

00:47:23.465 --> 00:47:24.985
What are you thinking, Ning?

00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:26.545
Why cause more trouble?

00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:29.865
Causing trouble, my ass.

00:47:29.945 --> 00:47:32.185
Everyone should know
about the announcement.

00:47:32.745 --> 00:47:33.825
Was I talking to you?

00:47:35.425 --> 00:47:36.585
What's wrong with you?

00:47:36.665 --> 00:47:38.545
-Fuck you.
-Hey, San!

00:47:38.625 --> 00:47:39.825
San, calm down!

00:47:39.905 --> 00:47:40.825
Chill.

00:47:40.905 --> 00:47:42.825
Welcome to the male shitshow.

00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:44.225
Hey, San! Calm down!

00:47:48.185 --> 00:47:49.985
Hold on, Ning. I'm with you.

00:47:50.065 --> 00:47:50.945
Hey…

00:47:51.025 --> 00:47:52.025
Non!

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:55.825
You guys wait here.

00:47:57.065 --> 00:47:57.945
Ning.

00:48:00.745 --> 00:48:02.145
Prepare to die.

00:48:04.265 --> 00:48:05.505
What are you saying, Prao?

00:48:06.265 --> 00:48:09.065
In zombie films,
when someone does something stupid,

00:48:09.505 --> 00:48:11.225
it's the extras who pay the price.

00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.345
Prao.

00:48:12.825 --> 00:48:15.465
What is wrong with you? Huh?

00:48:15.985 --> 00:48:18.345
You always say fucked up shit.

00:48:19.065 --> 00:48:20.305
Am I wrong, Thi?

00:48:42.945 --> 00:48:44.385
People here probably made it.

00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:49.265
They're trapped in the university.

00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:53.705
Okay.

00:48:53.785 --> 00:48:55.625
Everything's set. You can speak now.

00:48:57.705 --> 00:48:58.705
Everyone…

00:49:05.905 --> 00:49:06.825
How's that?

00:49:10.545 --> 00:49:12.185
My name is Ning Karnpitcha,

00:49:13.185 --> 00:49:15.025
a senior from the faculty of science.

00:49:16.345 --> 00:49:18.625
Thirteen of my friends and I

00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:20.425
are taking refuge in the library.

00:49:21.345 --> 00:49:23.265
We heard the announcement on the radio

00:49:23.345 --> 00:49:26.265
saying that the power and water
will be cut off at 8:30 p.m.

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:31.065
You might've noticed
that your phone signal is gone.

00:49:32.145 --> 00:49:34.145
We cannot contact people outside.

00:49:35.945 --> 00:49:39.225
However, tomorrow at 8 a.m.,

00:49:39.305 --> 00:49:41.545
military helicopters
will conduct daily patrols

00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:43.305
to search for survivors.

00:49:43.825 --> 00:49:46.105
To those hearing this,

00:49:46.185 --> 00:49:47.905
let me repeat myself.

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:52.265
Tomorrow at 8 a.m., military helicopters
will conduct daily patrols

00:49:52.345 --> 00:49:54.025
to search for survivors.

00:49:54.585 --> 00:49:56.705
Survivors must seek higher ground.

00:49:57.105 --> 00:50:01.225
It could be the rooftop of a building
or any spot visible from above.

00:50:02.225 --> 00:50:04.985
We, the survivors at the library,
are heading for--

00:50:05.505 --> 00:50:07.105
Ning, stop.

00:50:08.025 --> 00:50:10.145
We can only take so much responsibility.

00:50:15.985 --> 00:50:17.585
We, the survivors at the library,

00:50:17.665 --> 00:50:19.785
are heading to the parking garage rooftop.

00:50:20.585 --> 00:50:22.385
If you can join us…

00:50:23.225 --> 00:50:24.745
please do so before sunrise.

00:50:25.465 --> 00:50:26.465
I repeat,

00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:28.265
the survivors at the library

00:50:28.345 --> 00:50:30.425
are heading to the parking garage rooftop.

00:50:31.105 --> 00:50:34.185
The library is safe.
We're here to take you in.

00:50:43.705 --> 00:50:45.065
The lights outside are out.

00:50:45.545 --> 00:50:47.225
You know what you just said?

00:50:48.185 --> 00:50:50.225
What if they bring zombies with them?

00:50:50.305 --> 00:50:51.905
Stop it, San.

00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:54.465
Your words don't fucking help at all.

00:50:55.145 --> 00:50:57.065
Ning, why did you say that?

00:50:57.145 --> 00:50:58.225
Calm down, okay?

00:51:43.545 --> 00:51:44.505
Hey!

00:51:44.785 --> 00:51:45.985
There it is!

00:51:46.065 --> 00:51:47.025
-Over there!
-Hey!

00:51:47.105 --> 00:51:48.105
Right there.

00:51:48.185 --> 00:51:49.305
-Whoa!
-Hey…

00:51:49.705 --> 00:51:50.905
Let's go, guys.

00:51:52.065 --> 00:51:53.265
-Oh?
-Whoa!

00:51:53.345 --> 00:51:54.425
-What the fuck?
-Hey!

00:51:54.505 --> 00:51:55.585
What?

00:52:02.545 --> 00:52:03.625
-Munin!
-Whoa!

00:52:04.505 --> 00:52:05.345
Whoa!

00:52:05.865 --> 00:52:07.265
We should leave, Sun!

00:52:07.345 --> 00:52:08.705
We can just leave it behind.

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:10.225
We can't.

00:52:10.305 --> 00:52:12.425
Kiatpipat Cheerleading Handbook
is in there!

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:16.785
Munin!

00:52:16.865 --> 00:52:17.785
Back off!

00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.345
I'm a graduate.

00:52:20.945 --> 00:52:22.825
You were so scared of me as a freshman!

00:52:26.505 --> 00:52:27.625
We're screwed!

00:52:39.145 --> 00:52:40.425
Duck! Take cover!

00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:41.505
Duck.

00:52:41.905 --> 00:52:42.905
What is it, Aek?

00:52:46.305 --> 00:52:47.425
Where are they going?

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:49.505
I don't know.

00:52:50.385 --> 00:52:51.625
But it's not a good sign.

00:53:09.385 --> 00:53:11.425
And what's next?

00:53:13.025 --> 00:53:13.905
Wait.

00:53:14.705 --> 00:53:15.985
That's all we can do.
