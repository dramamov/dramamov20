"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 1)

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.680
My name is Xu Jingxi.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.200
I'm an HR Manager of a Fortune 500 Company.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.160
My annual salary is 500,000.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.079
Tomorrow, March 8th, is Women's Day.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.560
All female colleagues have a day off.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.160
Thank you.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.000
This is my dream.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.200
But reality is cruel.

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:03.799
This is the third time, boss.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.240
How can I eat without chopsticks?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.880
Who told you that when I order
pilaf I'll eat it with my hands?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.400
Next time if you don't give chopsticks,
I'll really file a complaint about you.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.360
Sis Shan, you are back.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.440
Yes

00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:20.600
I came back yesterday.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.000
Brought you local specialties.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.320
Thank you, Sis Shan

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.600
I heard that you are on leave.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.119
I went for a physical
examination yesterday.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.056
Haven't I been having
constant stomachaches recently?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.040
The company's employee benefits
will expire if I don't use them this year.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.239
How many times have I told you?

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.080
Don't eat takeout from such a small placce.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.319
Even if you save money,
you should not save money on meals.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.320
Either you eat instant
noodles or stuff like this.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280
Got it.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.400
The boss asked me to tell you to
see him after you're done eating.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.000
What's the matter?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.960
The company lost a major client recently.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:56.225
The boss must be in a bad mood.

00:04:56.888 --> 00:04:57.888
Be careful.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.090
Jing Xi.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.210
Let me level with you.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.770
The company's operations
are experiencing some issues.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.690
We have to lay off employees.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.170
Originally, I could have
asked HR to talk to you.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.570
But I think.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.810
I still need to speak with you in person.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.050
What do you mean?

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.650
You're going to fire me.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.066
Doesn't the problem that the company's
operations aren't well reflect on yourself?

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.026
Other than showing off that you're the
boss every day, what else can you do?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.050
You make like 800 demands every day.

00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:39.409
Changing your mind every minute.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.210
Do you really know what
you want by yourself?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.009
Firing me?

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.106
As if firing a beast of burden like me making
minimum wage would make your company “fly.”

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.130
Let me tell you.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.050
Pigs will NEVER fly.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.370
Everyone may have thought about
the scenario of going off on your boss.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.850
So did I.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.010
I understand.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.810
Thank you, boss.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.970
I'm already so unlucky.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.170
Can I be more unlucky?

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.650
But the facts tell me.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.210
I really can.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.290
Hello.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.130
Hello, do you have a reservation?

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.690
Yes.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.090
My name is Xu Jingxi.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.650
The last 4 digits of my number is 9377.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.890
OK, wait a moment.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.369
You have booked a King bed room for 7 days.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.210
Please put your ID
card here for registration.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.810
Sorry

00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:56.289
I am traveling.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.330
Then I accidentally lost my
mobile phone and ID card.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.130
So...?

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.569
So could you possibly make an exception?

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.130
Let me check in first.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.330
Sorry.

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:10.050
According to the regulations, guests
must bring their ID card to check in.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.906
You can check in only after registration.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.850
If you don't have an ID card.

00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:14.410
I have no way to verify your identity

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.929
I know.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.409
But I just told you.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.250
My name is Xu Jingxi

00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:19.529
I also told you the last digit of
my mobile phone number.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.290
You also checked it

00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:21.889
I have booked a room for 7 days, right?

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.649
Yes, but I can't enter the information.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.170
Sorry

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.010
I admit it was my carelessness.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.129
But could you possible
make an exception this time?

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.130
Sis.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.450
Sis Shan.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.409
If you're in a hurry, you
can go to the police station.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.690
They can get you a temporary ID.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.890
[Then] I can check you in.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.610
Then I'll keep my luggage here first.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.330
Wait a minute.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.129
I see that you just
make a room reservation.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.690
You haven't paid for the room.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.450
Are you sure you want to stay?

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.649
If you do, please pay for the room.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.970
The total is 1,806 yuan.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.130
But I lost my wallet.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.089
Can I borrow your phone?

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.930
I'll call my phone to see
if anyone picked it up.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.090
What are you doing?

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.810
What's with that look.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.610
I'm not a liar.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.809
The one above is my phone number.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.610
The one below.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.050
It's my.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.409
It's my mother's phone number.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.130
What are you doing?

00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:35.490
Can you call for me?

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.210
Can you call for me?

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.890
9377

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.569
Hello, the number you dialed is turned off.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.570
Turned off.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.729
Then call my mother.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.250
Ask her to pay for the room.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.410
Since you're helping, might
as well do it all the way.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:18.570
Hello.

00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:19.690
This is Time Inn.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.569
Your daughter Xu Jingxi.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.849
She booked a room here.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.649
But she lost her ID card and mobile phone.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.889
You need to pay for the room.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.289
The total is 1,800.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.090
What kind of scamming telemarketer?

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:31.755
Trying to cheat an old lady out of money.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.170
No, auntie.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.970
I'm not a liar.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.849
Your daughter's name is Xu Jingxi, right?

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.330
No

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.130
I don't have a daughter.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.090
My daughter is dead.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.130
Wait, auntie.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.050
Hang up.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.570
Sorry.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.370
I had an argument with
my mom when I went out.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.530
A big argument.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.210
I'm not afraid to tell you
now that it's come to this.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.450
I am sick.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.290
Terminal illness.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.610
An incurable disease.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.729
I'm going to die.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.530
Can you help me?

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.650
You go out and travel.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.450
You had an argument with your mom.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:16.810
You lost your ID card.

00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:18.091
And also lost your mobile phone.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.370
And you are sick.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.130
You don't believe it.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.370
Then.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:26.690
Then let me borrow your phone.

00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:28.769
Let me to log in to my WeChat or Alipay

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.210
I'll transfer the room fee to you.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.090
How can you receive the verification
code if you don't have a mobile phone?

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.010
I'll go to my carrier to apply for one.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.050
How will you get a phone card
if you don't have your ID card?

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.730
Perfect closed loop.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.850
Thank you.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.250
In running this business I've
seen many different kinds of people.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.009
Ones like you who say they have no money.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.930
So many people want to
cheat for food and drink.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.210
But you are persistent.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.930
You waited until now.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.090
I'm not a liar.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.170
When I was helping another girl,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.450
I accidentally lost my ID card and wallet.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.090
Liars would never say they are liars.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.970
Ah, let it go.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.130
No matter if you are a liar or not.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.210
Here is 100 yuan for you.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.090
Take it to buy some food.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.650
It's dark.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.890
I'm not a liar.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.930
You can pay it back if
you have the money later.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.170
I will pay it back.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.170
Do you want to be a attendant here?

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.010
One hundred yuan a day,
food and accommodation included
